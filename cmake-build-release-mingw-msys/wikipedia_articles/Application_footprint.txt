In computing, footprint of an application software (or application footprint) provides a sense of sizing of its various constituents, and hence, is a spatial measurement, in a given context, such as disk footprint, memory footprint (a.k.a. runtime footprint), network footprint, etc. In each case, footprint of an application excludes data that it may operate on, as part of storage or execution, but essentially includes programs (executable and libraries), configuration files, resources (binary or textual) and other context-specific components that may be considered as part of the software.
Whereas disk footprint of an application refers to its storage size, runtime footprint translates to memory requirements at execution time. Network footprint, on the other hand, refers to the extent of control information that a network-based application references, again, excluding any data that it may require to transmit (download or upload) to carry its activities. For example, the network footprint of an application that fetches execution logs from a server does not include the sizes of logs it would have fetched in a typical session, but would include control messages that it would have sent and...
