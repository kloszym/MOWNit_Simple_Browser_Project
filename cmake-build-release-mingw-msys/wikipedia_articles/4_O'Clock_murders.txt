The 4 O'Clock murders was a coordinated shooting of four people at the same time on June 6, 1988, at three locations in Texas led by Mormon fundamentalist leader Heber LeBaron of the Church of the Firstborn. Heber was the successor as church leader to Ervil LeBaron (nicknamed the "Mormon Manson" after Charles Manson): 4  of the similarly named Church of the First Born of the Lamb of God. Ervil had previously orchestrated the murder of several others he perceived as apostates. Authorities say the religious organizations were responsible for over 20 deaths over several decades.
