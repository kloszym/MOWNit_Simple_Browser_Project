The 1982 Icelandic Cup was the 23rd edition of the National Football Cup.
It took place between 26 May 1980 and 29 August 1982, with the final played at Laugardalsvöllur in Reykjavík. The cup was important, as winners qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup (if a club won both the league and the cup, the defeated finalists would take their place in the Cup Winners' Cup).
The 10 clubs from the 1. Deild entered in the last 16, with clubs from lower tiers entering in the three preliminary rounds. Teams played one-legged matches. In case of a draw, the match was replayed at the opposition's ground.
ÍA beat Keflavík, and so qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.
