The Turkish Cup (Turkish: Türkiye Kupası) is a football cup competition in Turkish football, run by the Turkish Football Federation since 1962. During a brief sponsorship period with Fortis, its sponsored name was Fortis Türkiye Kupası. Now Ziraat Bankası is the sponsor and the sponsored name for the cup is Ziraat Turkish Cup (Turkish: Ziraat Türkiye Kupası).
The cup was created in 1962 and has taken place every year since then. Many different formats, including a pure knockout competition and group stages, have been tried and finally for the 2012–13 season, an expanded tournament format has been adopted. A record 156 teams compete in the tournament. After five knockout rounds, a round-robin group stage is contested. Group winners and runners-up play in semi-finals and finals. The last champion is Galatasaray.
