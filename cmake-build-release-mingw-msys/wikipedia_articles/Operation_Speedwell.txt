During World War II, Operation Speedwell was an early Special Air Service raid against Italian rail targets near Genoa starting on 7 September 1943. It formed part of Operation Slapstick.  The fourteen-man group split into a number of smaller units to destroy track and ambush trains. The surviving raiders returned to friendly lines on foot after up to seven months behind enemy lines, some after time in captivity.
