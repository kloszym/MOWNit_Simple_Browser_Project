Lo Mato (Si No Compra Este LP), in English: "I'll kill him. (If you don't buy this LP)", is the eighth studio album of Willie Colón & Héctor Lavoe issued in 1973 by Fania Records. It was the fourth of Colón and Lavoe's records to go gold, after Cosa Nuestra (1970), La Gran Fuga (1971), and El Juicio (1972).
The cover shows a variant of the National Lampoon, January 1973 cover If you don't buy this magazine, we'll kill this dog. The man being held up on the cover, while reversing the roles with Willie on the floor on the reverse, was José R. Padrón.
