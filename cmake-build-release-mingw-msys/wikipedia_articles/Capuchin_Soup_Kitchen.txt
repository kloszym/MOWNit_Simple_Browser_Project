The Capuchin Soup Kitchen (CSK) is a religiously affiliated soup kitchen and non-profit organization located in Detroit, Michigan. It was founded by the Capuchin friars to provide food for the poor during the Great Depression and is sponsored by the Capuchin Franciscan Province of St. Joseph. While it was initially established as a soup kitchen, CSK now includes a food and clothing bank, a drug rehabilitation program, and an after school and summer youth program. Through its various ministries CSK serves approximately 560,000 individuals each year.


== History ==
The Capuchin Soup Kitchen was founded in 1929 by Capuchin friars Solanus Casey and Herman Buss. CSK was started in order to address the needs of Detroit's poor population during the Great Depression. The friars at St. Bonaventure Monastery initially established the kitchen informally by providing food from their own stores, as was the expectation in their order. As the porter of the monastery, Casey would provide each person who came seeking assistance with a cup of coffee and a sandwich.
The line outside of the Capuchin Monastery eventually grew up to 2,000 people each day, making it infeasible for the friars to serve everyone...
