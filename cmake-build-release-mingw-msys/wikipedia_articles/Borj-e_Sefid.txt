Borj-e Sefid (Persian: برج سفید) is a building located in Pasdaran district in Tehran, Iran.

The Borj-e Sefid (which translates to "White Tower" in English) is a high-rise building built along Pasdaran Ave, within which is contained a shopping center as well as many offices. The building has cemented Pasdaran's status as an upscale suburb of Tehran, raising the area's profile and spurring a series of developments in the surrounding areas. It is home to the revolving restaurant of Borj-e Sefid at the top floor of the building.
Although the building is a center of business and commerce and is part of a trend towards increasing urbanity in the district (mainly witnessed along the district's northern edge near Farmanieh), the majority of the area's housing remains relatively suburban in nature, consisting mostly of mansions and townhomes or duplexes.
