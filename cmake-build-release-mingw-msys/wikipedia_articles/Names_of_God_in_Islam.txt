Names of God in Islam (Arabic: أَسْمَاءُ ٱللَّٰهِ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ, romanized: ʾasmāʾu llāhi l-ḥusnā, lit. 'Allah's Beautiful Names') are 99 names that each contain Attributes of God in Islam, which are implied by the respective names.
These names usually denote his praise, gratitude, commendation, glorification, magnification, perfect attributes, majestic qualities, and acts of wisdom, mercy, benefit, and justice from Allah, as believed by Muslims. These names are commonly called upon by Muslims during prayers, supplications, and remembrance, as they hold significant spiritual and theological importance, serving as a means for Muslims to connect with God. Each name reflects a specific attribute of Allah and serves as a means for believers to understand and relate to the Divine.
Some names are known from either the Qur’an or the hadith, while others can be found in both sources, although most are found in the Qur’an. Additionally, Muslims also believe that there are more names of God besides those found in the Qur'an and hadith and that God has kept knowledge of these names hidden with himself, and no one else knows them completely and fully except him.
