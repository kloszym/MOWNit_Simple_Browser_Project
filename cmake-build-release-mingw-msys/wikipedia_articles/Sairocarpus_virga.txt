It is endemic to the North Coast Ranges of northern California, where it grows in rocky chaparral, sometimes on serpentine soils. This is a hairless perennial herb producing erect, non-climbing stems from a woody caudex. The inflorescence is a raceme atop the stem filled loosely with pink snapdragon flowers. Each flower is between one and two centimeters long.
