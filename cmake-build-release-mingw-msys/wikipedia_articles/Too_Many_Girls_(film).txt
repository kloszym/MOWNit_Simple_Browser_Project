Too Many Girls is a 1940 American musical comedy film directed by George Abbott, who had also directed the hit Broadway musical on which it was based, which ran for 249 performances. The film's screenplay is by John Twist, and it stars Lucille Ball, Richard Carlson, Ann Miller, Eddie Bracken, Frances Langford, Desi Arnaz and Hal Le Roy.
Too Many Girls was released by RKO Pictures on October 8, 1940, to mixed critical reception. In the decades since its release, it has become well-known primarily because Ball and Arnaz portrayed characters that have nothing to do with each other in the screenplay and dance numbers, but they met and became friendly for the first time during filming.  They eloped and married approximately six months after filming wrapped.  Their wedding took place shortly after the film's release.
