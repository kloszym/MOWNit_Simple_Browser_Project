Trogoderma is a genus of beetles in the family Dermestidae, the skin beetles. There are about 135 species worldwide.
Some species are pests of stored animal and plant products.


== Taxonomy ==
Recent research shows that Trogoderma (in its broad, traditional definition) is polyphyletic. Many species in the Southern Hemisphere are in a clade that is genetically distinct from the Holarctic species clade, which led to their proposed reclassification under the genus Eurhopalus (Zhou et al., 2022). However, this change is not widely adopted - e.g., the World Dermestidae Catalogue (Jiří Háva, 2023) still recognizes the old classification system and actively reinstated several genera synonymized with Eurhopalus.
