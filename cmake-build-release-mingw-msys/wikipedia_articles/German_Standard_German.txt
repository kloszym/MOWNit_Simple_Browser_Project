German Standard German, Standard German of Germany, or High German of Germany, is the variety of Standard German that is written and spoken in Germany. It is the variety of German most commonly taught to foreigners.
It is not uniform, which means it has considerable regional variation. Linguist Anthony Fox writes that British English is more standardized than German Standard German.
