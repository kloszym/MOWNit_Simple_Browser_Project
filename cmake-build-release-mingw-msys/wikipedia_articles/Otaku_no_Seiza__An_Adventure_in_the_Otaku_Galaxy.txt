Otaku no Seiza: An Adventure in the Otaku Galaxy (おたくの星座, lit. "Constellation of the Geeks") is a role-playing video game developed by Advance Communications and published by M&M for the Famicom on 1991. Aurora Quest: Otaku no Seiza in Another World (オーロラクエスト おたくの星座) is a remake of the Famicom version for the PC Engine Super CD-ROM by Pack-In-Video in December 1993–which featured updated graphics. Neither version was released outside of Japan. An OVA adaptation of this was also released in Japan on 1994.
The game combines science fiction and comedy. In it, an unnamed hero arrives in the city where women stole the rights of men. The player controls a man as he tries to free other men around the city. Otaku no Seiza features turn-based battles, similar to those of the Dragon Quest series.


== Gameplay ==
Otaku no Seiza features standard role-playing video gameplay. Players control a party of characters through overhead environments, including towns, dungeons, and a world map. While on the world map or in a dungeon, the party will randomly encounter enemies. The perspective switches to a first-person mode and the enemies and party members take turns attacking or healing.
