WASP-17b, officially named Ditsö̀, is an exoplanet in the constellation Scorpius that is orbiting the star WASP-17. Its discovery was announced on 11 August 2009. It is the first planet discovered to have a retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits in a direction counter to the rotation of its host star. This discovery challenged traditional planetary formation theory. In terms of diameter, WASP-17b is one of the largest exoplanets discovered and at half Jupiter's mass, this made it the most puffy planet known in 2010. On 3 December 2013, scientists working with the Hubble Space Telescope reported detecting water in the exoplanet's atmosphere.
WASP-17b's name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Costa Rica, during the 100th anniversary of the International Astronomical Union. Ditsö̀ is the name that the god Sibö̀ gave to the first Bribri people in Talamancan mythology.

A team of researchers led by David Anderson of Keele University in Staffordshire, England, discovered the gas giant, which is about 1,000 light-years (310 parsecs) from Earth, by observing it transiting its host star WASP-17. Such photometric observations also reveal the planet's size. The discovery...
