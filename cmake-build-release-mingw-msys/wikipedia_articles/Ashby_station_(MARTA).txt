Ashby is an underground subway station in Atlanta, Georgia, serving the Blue and Green lines of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) rail system. It incorporates the use of split platforms, where the westbound platform is on the upper level and the eastbound platform is on the lower level. This is to facilitate the Green Line's split toward Bankhead, immediately west of this station.


== History ==
Ashby was opened on December 22, 1979 along with all other stations west of Five Points, including the Five Points East/West section itself and excluding Bankhead. Ashby is part of the second oldest section of MARTA, only preceded by the stations east of Five Points.

== Renaming proposals ==
In 2007 Ashby was proposed to be renamed after Joseph E. Lowery, the current name of Ashby Street, while a different proposal by councilman Ivory Lee Young, Jr. suggested changing it to Historic Westside Village station, after the mixed-use development adjacent to the station.
