=== Older churches ===
Ingå, which is found in written sources for the first time in 1337, is one of the oldest parishes of western Uusimaa region. Some older churches made of tree have stood on the place of the stone church we see today. The stone walls of Saint Nicholas church also include parts of an even older stone church that once stood on the site.


=== The current church ===
The patron saint of the current medieval stone church is Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of among other things sailors.
