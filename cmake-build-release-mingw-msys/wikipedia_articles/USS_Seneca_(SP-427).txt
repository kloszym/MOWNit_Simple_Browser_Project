The third USS Seneca (SP-427), later USS SP-427, was a United States Navy minesweeper and patrol vessel in commission from 1917 to 1919.
Seneca was built as a civilian steam yacht in 1888 at Boston, Massachusetts. On 7 May 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired her from her owner, the Johnson Lighterage Company, for use as a minesweeper and patrol vessel on the section patrol during World War I. She was commissioned as USS Seneca (SP-427) on 17 July 1917.
Based at Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York, Seneca carried out minesweeping and patrol duties for the rest of World War I. In 1918, she was renamed USS SP-427.
SP-427 was decommissioned on 2 January 1919. She was stricken from the Navy List on 6 January 1919 and returned to Johnson Lighterage the same day.
Seneca (SP-427) should not be confused the barge USS Seneca (SP-1240), which was in commission at the same time.
