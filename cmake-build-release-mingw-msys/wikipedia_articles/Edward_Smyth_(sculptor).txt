Edward Smyth (1749 â€“ 2 August 1812) was an Irish sculptor.

The son of a stonecutter, Smyth was born in County Meath, Ireland. He was employed by Henry Darley, who was in turn an employee of James Gandon and later was an apprentice of Hugh Darley. By this connection, Smyth met Gandon, who was greatly impressed with his work.  Gandon employed Smyth as the sculptor to the Custom House, as well as for all of his Dublin projects. These included the Four Courts, the Irish House of Lords, and King's Inns.
In 1787, Smyth completed statues to his own design above the Westmoreland Street entrance (the "Lords' Entrance", which was added by Gandon) of the Irish Houses of Parliament. In 1807, he carved the statues above the main entrance of the same building (which had been taken over by the Bank of Ireland) on College Green. These represent Hibernia flanked by Commerce and Fidelity.
Smyth was also employed by the architect Francis Johnston. He carved the heads on the exterior of Johnston's Chapel Royal in Dublin Castle until his death, whereupon his son John continued the work.
Smyth was the first Master of the Dublin Society School of Modeling and sculpture. He died suddenly on 2 August 1812...
