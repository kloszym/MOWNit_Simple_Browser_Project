The Reynard 02S was a Le Mans Prototype race car built by Reynard Motorsport in 2002.  Intended to replace the failed Reynard 2KQ prototype, the 02S would end up becoming the final new design from Reynard as the company went bankrupt prior to the project's completion.
International Racing Management bought the rights to the 02S project and would complete the car under the name DBA4 03S.  In 2004, Zytek would be tasked with building more chassis, which would be sold under the name Zytek 04S before being upgraded to the Zytek 06S.  A further alternative was created by Creation Autosportif in 2006, named the Creation CA06/H.  Some of the chassis continue to be used, although they have been extensively modified from the original Reynard designs.
