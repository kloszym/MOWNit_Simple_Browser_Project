The Córdoba International Animation Festival – ANIMA is a competitive animated film and media festival held in Córdoba, Argentina.
ANIMA's first edition was held in April 2001, and has been replicated in odd years since, therefore being Argentina's first and longest standing animation festival. The festival is jointly organized by the Centro Experimental de Animación (CEAn), an animation research and production centre at the Faculty of Arts, National University of Córdoba; and the Animation Chair of the National University of Villa María.


== Overview ==
ANIMA revolves around three sections:

The festival itself, which welcomes all sorts of animation with no limitations to technique, genre, topic, format and/or screening media.
Formative opportunities in animation, through seminars, workshops and masterclasses.
An academic conference called FAIA – Foro Académico Internacional de Animación. Established in 2007, FAIA is the first Latin American conference on the subject. Proceedings of the conference are published both, on paper and online.
