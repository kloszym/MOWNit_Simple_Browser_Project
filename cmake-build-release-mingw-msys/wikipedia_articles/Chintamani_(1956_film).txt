== Plot ==
The film follows the story of Chintamani, a courtesan who, despite being a devotee of Krishna, is coerced by her greedy mother, Srihari, into luring and robbing the wealth of Bhavani Sankarudu, a Brahmin, and Subbi Setti, a merchant. Bilvamangaludu, the son of Vasudeva Murthy, a gold merchant, lives a happy life with his devoted wife, Radha. Bilvamangaludu becomes infatuated with Chintamani, and although Vasudeva Murthy warns Bilvamangaludu, his son ignores the advice, leading to his father’s illness and eventual death. Bilvamangaludu’s obsession with Chintamani grows, and he disregards his father’s death on a stormy night. Beyond that, he crosses the river with the aid of the carcass of none other than Radha, who died falling from the cliff backing him. He climbs the compound with what he believes is a crupper but is actually a snake.
