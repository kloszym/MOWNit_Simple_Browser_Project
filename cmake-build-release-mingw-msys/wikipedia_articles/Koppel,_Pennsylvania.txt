== History ==

Koppel was named after Arthur Koppel of Orenstein & Koppel, which was a German manufacturing company that owned 558 acres of land in nearby Big Beaver Township by 1907. In 1912, Koppel was established as a borough. The next year, Orenstein & Koppel donated land to the new borough for school and municipal buildings. After most of the town was confiscated by the Office of Alien Property Custodian from Orenstein & Koppel in 1917, much of the property was sold to the Koppel Industrial and Equipment Company. Other manufacturing companies had a presence in Koppel—the Pressed Steel Car Co. from 1919 to 1937 and Babcock & Wilcox during the 1950s.
