Dinosaur Land is a tourist attraction in White Post, Virginia established in 1963. The park has more than fifty dinosaur statues; the differing styles of the recreations demonstrate changing anatomical knowledge and aesthetic design over the decades.


== Description and history ==
Dinosaur Land was started around 1963 by Joseph Geraci as a gift shop called "Rebel Korner"; the name was changed to Dinosaur Land in 1967. Geraci admired other dinosaur sculptures created by James Q. Sidwell, a dinosaur replica designer for the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, and commissioned Sidwell to create sculptures for a gift shop. The site was started with five dinosaurs created with wooden frames covering wire mesh and fiberglass; new sculptures were added regularly throughout the years. Several of the original dinosaurs were covered with fur and had moving parts, such as a woolly mammoth statue with a moving trunk and flapping ears; those elements have been removed as they were difficult to maintain.

About 35 of the dinosaurs on display were created by Sidwell. The park's newer, more scientifically accurate dinosaurs have been created by Mark Cline, creator of nearby roadside attractions...
