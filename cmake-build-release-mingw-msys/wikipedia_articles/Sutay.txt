Sutay or Sutai (Mongolian: ᠰᠤᠲᠠᠶ, Persian: سوتای) (died 1332) was a Mongol emir and governor of Diyar Bakr. He was appointed by Öljaitü as viceroy. His descendants held Diyar Bakr in their hands following the dissolution of the Ilkhanate and made it hereditary.


== Background ==
His tribal affiliation is not known. Turkish historian Faruk Sümer proposed that he was of the Sunud tribe and Sutai was just an abbreviation for Sunitai (Mongolian: Сөнөд + ай, lit. 'Belonging to Sunud'). Ishayahu Landa too believes that Sutay was a member of the Sunud. According to Mamluk historian Al-Safadi, he took part in Siege of Baghdad and was over 100 years old when he died in 1332. But Faruk Sümer doubted that and proposed that Mamluk historians mistook him for Chagatay the Younger otherwise known as Sunitai - an emir from the Sunud tribe and Hulagu's mingghan commander.


== Career under Ghazan ==
He was an akhtachi (Mongolian: агтчин, lit. 'Groom or Stable master') and rose to prominence during Ghazan's viceroyalty in Khorasan. He served alongside Mulay, Qutlughshah and Nurin Aqa and fought in Ghazan's war against Nawruz from 1289 to 1294. He also commanded an army during Ghazan's war against Baydu...
