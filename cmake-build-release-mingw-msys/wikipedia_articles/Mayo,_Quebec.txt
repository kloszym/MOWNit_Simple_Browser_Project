Mayo is a municipality in the Papineau Regional County Municipality of western Quebec, located northeast of the city of Gatineau (Buckingham sector). Mayo is south of the hamlet of Mulgrave-et-Derry.


== History ==
The area which would become the municipality of Mayo in 1864, just north of the township of Lochaber, began to be settled in the nineteenth century mainly by Irish and German immigrants as well as French Canadians.  The Irish settlers arrived in Mayo between 1820-1830, pre-famine immigrants.  They would have arrived in Montreal and traveled along the Ottawa River and then along the Blanche River.  The settlers would have found great comfort in their new surroundings, the hilly terrain resembling that of Ireland, and subsequently their new home was named Mayo after County Mayo in Ireland.  The main industries which drive the economics of the municipality were, and still are, farming and forestry as well as the manufacturing of potash.
