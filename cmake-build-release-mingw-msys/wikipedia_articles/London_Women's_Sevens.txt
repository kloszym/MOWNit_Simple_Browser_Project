The London Women's Sevens is part of the London Sevens, and was first played in 2012 when the IRB promoted a Women's Challenge tournament that was hosted alongside the existing men's tournament.
In 2013 the tournament was an invitational event organised and sponsored by the RFU. The tournament was not held in 2014, but was reinstituted for the 2015 season as the first edition of the London Sevens to be a part of the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series.
