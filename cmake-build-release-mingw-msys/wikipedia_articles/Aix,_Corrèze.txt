Aix (French pronunciation: [ɛks]; Occitan: Ais) is a commune in the Corrèze department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of central France.


== Geography ==
Aix is located some 50 km south-west of Clermont-Ferrand.  The south eastern section of the commune is traversed by the TransEuroppienne Motorway (E70 / A89).  Exit No. 24 is just next to the border and this exit to the north connects the motorway to the Highway D1089 which runs fairly parallel to the motorway from Ussel in the south-west to Merlines in the north-east passing through the heart of the commune. To reach the village of Aix it is possible to take the D40E2 which branches from the D1089 south-west of the commune and goes directly to the town. The town can also be accessed from the west on the D49 from Saint-Pardoux-le-Vieux which, after passing through the town, continues east to link with the D1089. There is also Highway D91 from the north as well as many small country roads.

To the south-east of the town about 1.5 km in a direct line is the railway station of La Marsalouse which is served by TER Limousin and TER Auvergne trains which link Clermont-Ferrand to Gare de Limoges-Bénédictins and Gare de Brive-la-Gaillarde...
