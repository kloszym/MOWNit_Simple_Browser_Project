The Vanity Set is an indie rock group of mostly second-generation Greek-Americans formed in New York City in 2000. Led by Jim Sclavunos, the drummer/percussionist with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, they describe their music as a blend of "low art, high sass and raw bluster." Their music includes the sounds of rebetiko, "psycho-billy guitar, creepy keys, raucous tuba, mellifluous theremin."
By 2022, Sclavunos told an interviewer for NME that the project was done. He also said in 2021 that he had a set of unfinished Vanity Set material that he was working on releasing.
