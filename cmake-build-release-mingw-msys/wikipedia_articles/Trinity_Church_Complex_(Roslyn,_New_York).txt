Trinity Church Complex is a historic church off of Northern Boulevard in Roslyn, New York. It is located on the westbound off-ramp from the William Cullen Bryant Viaduct and Church Street, the latter of which also leads to the St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church of Roslyn, on the northeast corner of Bryant and Summit Avenues.
