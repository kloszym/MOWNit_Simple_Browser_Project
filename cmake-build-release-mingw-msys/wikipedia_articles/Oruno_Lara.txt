Oruno Lara (1879 – 1924) was a Guadeloupean poet, author and historian, not to be confused with his grandson Dr. Oruno D. Lara, also a historian. Head of Pointe-à-Pitre's  Guadeloupe Littéraire journal, he arrived in France in 1914 with hopes of further developing his project of a literary and political journal. He was soon engulfed in the first World War until 1919 and following  traumas caused by the inhalation of gases used during the  war, he was inspired  to become a historian. Upon his return from war, he published a history of Guadeloupe, a text which was used to teach several generations of  Guadeloupean school children. In 1919, he founded the monthly Le Monde Colonial (The Colonial World) which echoed W.E.B. Dubois' and the first Pan-African Congress' denunciations of the racism inherent to European colonialism.  In 1923 he wrote the novel Question de Couleurs: Blanches et Noirs, Roman de Moeurs ( i.e. An issue of Colors: Whites and Blacks, a Novel)
