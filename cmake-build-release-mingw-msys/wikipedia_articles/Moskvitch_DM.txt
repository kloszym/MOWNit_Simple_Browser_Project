The Moskvitch DM (also known as UMZ-412 or UZAM-412) was an automobile engine developed by Avtomobilny Zavod imeni Leninskogo Komsomola (Lenin Komsomol Automobile Factory, AZLK) under the Moskvitch brand, for the Moskvich 412.
Design of the 1,478 cc (90.2 cu in) DM began in response to the increasing power of Western Europe's competitors to the just-introduced Moskvitch 408. The existing engine's displacement could not be enlarged profitably, so the AZLK team, led by Igor Okunev, started with a clean sheet. It had a very stiff five-bearing crankshaft, and a very high-mounted camshaft (resembling the Hillman Avenger). Oknuev, drawing on his experience in motorcycles, saw he could eliminate pushrods and raise the top rev limit, to 5,800 from the earlier engine's 4750.
The cam was chain-driven, and the block, head, sump, rocker cover, intake manifold, and other parts were aluminum. It weighed only 146 kg (322 lb), just 6 kg (13 lb) more than the previous 1,360 cc (83 cu in), but produced 75 hp (56 kW; 76 PS). It had removable cylinder liners, with both the aluminum oil pump and distributor driven off the crankshaft.
Prototype engines were delivered in 1964. It was tested in racing in summer...
