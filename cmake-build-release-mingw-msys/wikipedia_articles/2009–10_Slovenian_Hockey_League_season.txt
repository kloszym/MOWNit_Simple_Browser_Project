The 2009–10 Slovenian Hockey League season was the 19th season of the Slovenian Ice Hockey League, the top domestic ice hockey competition in Slovenia. The 2009–10 season was quite different from previous seasons. The new Slohokej League, a multi-national league, in effect replaced the regular part of the Slovenian league, leaving only the playoffs. The playoffs were now opened only open to Slovenian teams, unlike in the past.
