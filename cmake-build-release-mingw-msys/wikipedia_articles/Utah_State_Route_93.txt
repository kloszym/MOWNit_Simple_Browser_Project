State Route 93 (SR-93) is a state highway in the US state of Utah providing a connection from I-15 to US-89. The highway is completely in the city limits of Woods Cross, spanning 0.37 miles (0.60 km). The entire route is routed along 2600 South. It was formed in 1965 coinciding with the construction of I-15 through the area. At the time of formation, the route at the eastern terminus was legislatively designated SR-106, though it was signed as US-89 and US-91. US-91 was decommissioned in 1974, and the designation of SR-106 changed to the signed route, US-89, in 1977.
