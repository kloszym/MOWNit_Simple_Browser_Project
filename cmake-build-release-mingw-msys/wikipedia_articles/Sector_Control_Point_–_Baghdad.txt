Sector Control Point-Baghdad (also known as SCP-B or "skip bee")was being the primary and largest of the Iraq Survey Group's three operational groups. SCP-B, along with the core of the ISG staff, were located on Camp Slayer at the former Al Radwaniyah Presidential Site on Baghdad International Airport in western Baghdad.
From its founding in the spring of 2003 until disbandment at the end of February 2005, SCP-B was commanded by a series of coalition officers from the U.S. Army, U.S. Marines and Australian Army. Its first commander was U.S. Army Reserve Colonel George Waldroup, who led the group from its founding until the summer of 2004. He was later picked by U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to head the Strategic Support Branch of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Following COL Waldroup, USMC COL Frank Johnson was pulled from retirement and took the reins until October 2004.  COL Johnson was followed by Lt Col Andy Carr, an Australian engineer, who was briefly followed by MAJ Peck (now LTC).  The final commander of SCP-B was Australian Military Police Major Damien Hick.
SCP-B's missions included not only the search for WMD, but work on counter-terrorism and the ongoing investigation...
