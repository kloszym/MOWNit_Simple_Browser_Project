Ranald was born in Chelsea.  His father worked for the New Zealand Midland Railway Company. He attended St Paul's School, London but showed little academic promise.
In December 1917 he was given the rank of Major and attached to the British military mission in Tbilisi. In the chaos of the time he took a 36-hour train journey there from Baku.
