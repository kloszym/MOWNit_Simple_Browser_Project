A microinfarct is a microscopic stroke generally ranging between 0.1 millimeter and 1 millimeter in size. Microinfarcts can be found in 25-50% of all elderly deceased persons. Microinfarcts may be the second most important cause of dementia, after Alzheimer's disease.
Microinfarcts are microscopic lesions, of cellular death or tissue necrosis, which are a result of pathologies involving small vessels. Such pathologies are arteriosclerosis or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Microinfarcts take longer to affect neuronal death progress, at up to 28 days, rather than hours.
This ailment usually goes undetected in clinical-radiological, like structural MRI, studies and is known as a “silent pathology”. Depending on the size, large acute microinfarcts may be detected via a special imaging technique known as diffusion weighted imaging.
Microinfarcts tend to occur at a high frequency, without specific regionalized locations. They are common in aging brains. This high frequency is thought to directly disrupt cognitive networks that are imperative to brain operation. Even though microinfarcts are usually undetectable, there is a general assessment of the cognitive status measured on a scale called...
