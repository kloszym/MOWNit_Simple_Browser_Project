Osvaldo Licini (22 March 1894 – 11 October 1958) was an Italian painter, active as an abstract artist.
Licini was born in Monte Vidon Corrado in the Marche. He studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna where one of his fellow students was Giorgio Morandi. Licini became an abstract artist around 1930 after his encounter with the Parisian Circle et Carré and Abstraction-Création groups. He was elected Mayor of Monte Vidon Corrado in 1946 and the town opened the Centro Studi Osvaldo Licini in 1986.
