== History and description ==
Alexander Linn, a Scotch-Irish farmer, built the two and one-half story frame building around 1750. He later became a judge of the county court and an elder of the Lamington Presbyterian Church. After his death in 1776, his son, James Linn, inherited the property. During the American Revolutionary War, he served in the Somerset County Militia under William Alexander, Lord Stirling. He later was elected to United States House of Representatives for the 1799â€“1801 term. In 1810, he moved to Trenton, New Jersey. The house was expanded with a one and one-half story wing with Federal style.
