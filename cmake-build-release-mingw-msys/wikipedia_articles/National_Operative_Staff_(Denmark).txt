The National Operative Staff (NOST) (Danish: National Operativ Stab (NOST)) is a collaboration at the highest level between authorities in Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. The staff's main task is to create an overview so that the government and other authorities have a sufficient basis for making decisions. The National Operative Staff is obliged to hold at least one alert exercise every six months. The Danish National Police coordinates the work.
NOST is activated, for example, by:

major accidents
disasters
terrorist attacks
cyber attacks
state visits
summits
NOST was established in 2005 by the government in connection with the tsunami in Thailand as part of the defense agreement 2005-09.
