Kaptai (Bengali: কাপ্তাই) is an upazila of Rangamati District in the Division of Chittagong, Bangladesh. The name of the Kaptai was derived from the Tripuri word "Kaptetoima". It is said that in the past, the river was wild and full of tropical flora and fauna. Large quantities and several varieties of canes could be found along the river bank that flows from the south, upper ridge. The river reaches its estuary at the Kainsa Khyong (Karnafuli River).
Notable landmarks are the Karnaphuli Hydroelectric Power Station, the only hydroelectric power plant of Bangladesh. The Kaptai Dam, built for this purpose on the Karnaphuli River, created the Kaptai Lake, the largest man-made dam in Bangladesh.
