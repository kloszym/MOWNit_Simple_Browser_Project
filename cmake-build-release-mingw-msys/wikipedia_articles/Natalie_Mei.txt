Natalie Johanna Mei (10 January 1900 – 29 July 1975) was an Estonian painter and graphic artist.
Born in Liepāja, in the Courland Governorate of the Russian Empire, Natalie Mei was one of three daughters of an Estonian ship's captain who was born in Hiiumaa. All three sisters would become artists, with Natalie and older sister Lydia Mei achieving public prominence during the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) period of Estonian art of the 1920s. Mei also worked as a costume designer and taught at the Tallinn Art Institute.
Mei is buried at the Rahumäe cemetery in Tallinn.
