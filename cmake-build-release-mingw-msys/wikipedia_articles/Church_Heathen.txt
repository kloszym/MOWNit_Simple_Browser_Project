The track serves a testimonial of some of the scandals and "heathens" he found in church. In the intro of the song, he states, "If you tek dis too serious, then you really need sum church", which is Patois for, "If you take this too seriously, then you really need some church." In the song he mentions characters such as Sis. Pam, who tells him everything about the congregation, Sis. Gwen, who claims that she is a Christian but dances to inappropriate songs in the opinion of Christians such as the Dutty Wine, Sis. Paulette, who is sleeping with the driver of a mini bus, a means of public transportation in the Caribbean, and also has a gay husband. He also states that the next Sunday he will 'find himself' in church because in his opinion, soap operas cannot be as 'sweet' as the information he is receiving in the church.
