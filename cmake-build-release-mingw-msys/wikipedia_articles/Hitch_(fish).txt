The hitch (Lavinia exilicauda) is a cyprinid fish endemic to central California, and was once very common. The common name may derive from a Pomoan word for this species. It is the only species in the monospecific genus Lavinia.


== Taxonomy ==
The hitch was first formally described in 1854 by Spencer Fullerton Baird and Charles Frédéric Girard with its type locality given as the Sacramento River in California. While the hitch is closely related to the California roach (Hesperoleucus symmetricus), and the two species can hybridize, leading some authorities to place H. symmetricus in Lavinia, genomic data appear to support the fishes' separate lineages. The Lavinia genus has been placed in the subfamily Leuciscinae of the family Cyprinidae in the 5th edition of Fishes of the World. Other authorities classify the Leuciscidae as a family and place the genus Lavinia in the subfamily Laviniinae of that family.
Three distinct population segments (DPS) or subspecies of the hitch are recognized:

Clear Lake hitch (chi in Pomoan language)
Monterey hitch (Salinas hitch, Pajaro hitch)
Sacramento hitch (Central Valley hitch)
These common names or DPS correspond to the subspecies Lavinia exilicauda...
