== History ==
It was first mentioned between 1108 and 1121 as de Ueno and means raised bog. Veen is a river bank settlement along the Afgedamde Maas which developed in the Middle Ages.
Its Dutch Reformed church dates from around 1200. The tower was added in the late 13th century. The church was destroyed in 1504 during the Guelders Wars, and later rebuilt. The church was enlarged in 1648. During the restoration of 1961 to 1963, it was returned to its medieval shape.
The grist mill De Hoop was built in 1838. In 1956, it was sold to the municipality who later transferred it to a foundation who restored the mill in 1970. In 1987, it was restored and elevated, because it was hit by trucks several times due to its proximity to the road. Since 2012, the mill is grinding professionally again.
Veen was home to 871 people in 1840. In 1880, the dike breached and most of the village was destroyed. It was later rebuilt...
