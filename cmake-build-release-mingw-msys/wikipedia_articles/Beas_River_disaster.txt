== Incident ==
48 students and three faculty/staff members of the V.N.R. Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology (Hyderabad) were on an educational/industrial tour from Shimla to Manali, about 200 kilometres (130 miles) from Himachal Pradesh capital Shimla. Some of them were photographing themselves on the banks of the Beas river on the Mandi-Manali National Highway NH-21, when they were washed away as the water flow in the river suddenly increased. The surge of water occurred when the Larji hydroelectric power project opened its floodgates, sending tonnes of water downstream.
The dam water was released suddenly by the dam authorities without prior notice. Two students Raman Teja Venigalla & Biswas Nandamuri were alarmed...
