Pyrrhospora endaurantia is a species of lichen in the family Lecanoraceae. Found in Kenya, it was described as a new species in 2021 by lichenologists Klaus Kalb and Andr√© Aptroot. The type was collected on the Roaring Rocks in Tsavo West National Park (Central Province), at an altitude of about 1,300 m (4,300 ft). Here it was found growing on tree twigs in a savannah. The lichen has a dull, pale grey thallus bordered by a black hypothallus about 0.1 mm wide. The specific epithet endaurantia refers to its orange-red subhymenium and orange hypothecium (the tissue immediately below the subhymenium). The thallus of the lichen turns yellow with the K chemical spot test. Thin-layer chromatography showed the presence of atranorin in the thallus.
