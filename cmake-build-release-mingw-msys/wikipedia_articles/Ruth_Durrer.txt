Ruth Durrer (born 1958) is a professor of Cosmology at the University of Geneva. She works on the cosmic microwave background, brane cosmology and massive gravity.


== Early life and education ==
Durrer was born in Kerns. She earned her high school diploma at Kantonales Lehrerseminar, and studied at the University of Z端rich. She completed her PhD on perturbation theory with Norbert Straumann at the University of Z端rich in 1988. She was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge for a year, before joining Princeton University in 1989. Durrer returned to Z端rich in 1991, completing a postdoctoral fellowship.


== Research and career ==
Durrer was made an assistant professor at the University of Z端rich in 1992, and full professor at the University of Geneva in 1995. She is a member of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. She works on the cosmic microwave background and massive gravity. Massive gravity describes an expanding universe with massive gravitons, which weakens gravity on large scales. Durrer uses cosmological observations as a test for general relativity.
Durrer has contributed extensively to the theoretical understanding of topological defects. She showed...
