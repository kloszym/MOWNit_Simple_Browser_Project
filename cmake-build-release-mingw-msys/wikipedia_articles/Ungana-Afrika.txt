Ungana-Afrika, Swahili for "connect africa", is a non-governmental organisation based in Pretoria, South Africa that provides a wide range of ICT services for civil society within and outside of the continent. It aims to better empower civil society organisations, networks and related stakeholders, in terms of ICT capacity and resources, so they can efficiently achieve their unique social missions.
Ungana-Afrika's efforts include addressing the critical digital divide issues within African civil society (such as the lack of technology capacity and universal access). Through the implementation of new support programmes and tools, capacity-building and general research they aim to connect Africa through information technology. Though some services are targeted directly to civil society organisations (across sectors), many of Ungana-Afrika's efforts are focused towards the empowerment of information technology service providers and general Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D) networks that jointly serve these organisations.
Ungana-Afrika's work has gathered several awards for community leadership.
