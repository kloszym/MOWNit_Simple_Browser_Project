The Hawaii Land Trust (HILT) is a non-profit organization established in Hawaii to â€œprotect the lands that sustain us for current and future generations". The organization works with landowners to protect important areas by restricting commercial or other development. This protection is provided either by the landowner accepting a conservation easement on the land or by selling the land to HILT. As of 2018, the organization protected more than 18,000 acres (7,300 ha) across the state.


== History ==
In January 2011, HILT was formed from the merger of the Kauai Public Land Trust, the Oahu Land Trust, the Maui Coastal Land Trust, and the Hawaii Island Land Trust.
The first executive director was Dale Bonar, followed by Ted Clement, Kawika Burgess, and then Laura Kaakua.
Originally named Hawaiian Islands Land Trust, in 2021 the organization renamed itself as Hawaii Land Trust, while retaining its acronym HILT.


== Services ==
In addition to its core function of conserving important lands for future generations, HILT provides educational services, research and opportunities for recreation.
