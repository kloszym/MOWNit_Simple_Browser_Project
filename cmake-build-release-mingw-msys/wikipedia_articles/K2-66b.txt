K2-66b is a confirmed mega-Earth orbiting the subgiant K2-66, about 520 parsecs (1,700 ly) from Earth in the direction of Aquarius. It is an extremely hot and dense planet heavier than Neptune, but with only about half its radius.


== Planet properties ==


=== Mass, radius, and temperature ===
K2-66b is a mega-Earth with radius 2.49 RðŸœ¨ and mass 21.3 ME. The planet's temperature is highly variable due to the variability of its host star, and is currently estimated at 1,372 K (1,099 Â°C; 2,010 Â°F).


=== Orbit ===
The planet orbits every 5.07 days at 0.06 AU. It orbits within a "photoevaporation desert", where orbiting exoplanets should be very uncommon. K2-66b's orbit is nearly circular.


== Star ==
The star, K2-66 is a G1 sub-giant in Aquarius. It has a sun-like temperature of 5887 K, which corresponds to its spectral class and is very close to that of the rotationally variable star Kepler-130. It has a radius of 1.67 Râ˜‰ and a mass of 1.11 Mâ˜‰.  Its metallicity is âˆ’0.047, and its apparent magnitude is 11.71.
