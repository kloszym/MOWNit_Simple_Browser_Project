Mahuli Fort, located 2815 ft above sea level, is a popular trekking and rock climbing destination. The nearby pinnacles, including Vazir and Vishnu, contribute to the enduring popularity of the location. The mountain complex consists of a group of two or more hills with common cols and pinnacles.
It is the highest point in Thane District. The forest surrounding Mahuli has been declared a sanctuary. Shahaji Maharaj, the father of Shivaji, occupied this fortress. The fort has been declared as a protected monument.
Besides an open Shiva temple, there is a small perennial drinking water cistern on top. The location also contains three caves, of which the larger one is sometimes used as overnight shelter, like on similar natural hill forts in the Maharashtrian Western Ghats (Sahyadri Range). There is a stone arch historically known as the 'Kalyan Darwaja', but the dome of the arch is now broken.
The nearest railway station to Mahuli is Asangaon.
