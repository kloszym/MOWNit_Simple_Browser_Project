== Life ==

Born Roland Loomis, at age 4, he claimed to have experienced dreams of past lives which, along with his anthropological studies, influenced his interests in body modification. He served in the army during the Korean War, and was first married for a short time in the 1960s. In 1966 or 1967, he first performed a flesh hook suspension, inspired by his viewing of anthropological works. In 1977, he gave himself the name Fakir Musafar.
In the 1985 documentary Dances Sacred and Profane, he was shown walking while wearing a device that pressed many small skewers into his upper body, and hanging from a tree by hooks in his chest, in his modified versions of other cultures' sacred ceremonies. He was an extra ('Man in hotel room') in Die Jungfrauen Maschine (The Virgin Machine) in 1988, and in 1991, he appeared in My Father Is Coming as Fakir. He was featured in the 1989 book Modern Primitives, which documented, propagated, and became influential in the modern body modification subcultures...
