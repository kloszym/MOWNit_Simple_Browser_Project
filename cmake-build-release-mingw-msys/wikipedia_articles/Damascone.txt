Damascones are a series of closely related chemical compounds that are components of a variety of essential oils.  The damascones belong to a family of chemicals known as rose ketones, which also includes damascenones and ionones.  beta-Damascone is a contributor to the aroma of roses, despite its relatively low concentration, and is an important fragrance chemical used in perfumery.
The damascones are derived from the degradation of carotenoids.
