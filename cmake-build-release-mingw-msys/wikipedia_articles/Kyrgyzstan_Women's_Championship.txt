Kyrgyzstan Women's League is the top division of women's football in Kyrgyzstan. The league is organized by the Football Federation of Kyrgyz Republic and was established in 2005. Before 1991, some Kyrgyz women's clubs had competed in the Soviet Union women's league system, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union most women's teams left for Russia or simply dissolved. 
As of late 2009 only 6 senior women's football teams existed in Kyrgyzstan, meaning there is no second level league.
