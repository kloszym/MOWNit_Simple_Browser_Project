Bravo was born in Toulouse to Spanish immigrants escaping the Spanish civil war settling in southern France. He made his debut for OGC Nice at 17 years of age in a game against Metz in the French Championship D1. Despite the relegation of Nice to D2 in 1982, he was called up to the French team to face Italy in February 1982. That night, the Blues beat Italy for the first time in over sixty years, and Bravo scored their second goal.
He stayed at Nice for their spell in D2 for one season and managed to score eleven goals. He then signed for AS Monaco. This was the beginning of a series of clubs he would play for that would lead to him playing for Paris Saint Germain and then in Italy. With the France national team, Bravo played infrequently in the blue jersey, but still participated in the victorious Euro 1984, replacing Jean-Marc Ferreri, during the match against Yugoslavia...
