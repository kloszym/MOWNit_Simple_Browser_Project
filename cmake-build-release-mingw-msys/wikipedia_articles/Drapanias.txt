Drapanias (Greek: Δραπανιάς) is a small village in northwestern Crete, in the regional unit of Chania. It was the principal town in the Cretan municipality of Kissamos. It was built in the ruins of the ancient town of Methymna.
The nearby village of Ano Drapanias ("Upper Drapanias") is sometimes considered to be part of Drapanias, with the northern beachside areas being referred to as Kato Drapanias ("Lower Drapanias").
Frequent KTEL buses connect the village with various locations, such as Kissamos and Chania.
The village and its people are memorialized in several works by the Cretan author Kimon Faradakis.
