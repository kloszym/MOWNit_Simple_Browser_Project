The 2019–20 Buildbase FA Vase was the 46th season of the FA Vase, an annual football competition for teams playing below Step 4 of the English National League System. The competition was played with two qualifying rounds preceding the six proper rounds, semi-finals (played over two legs) and final to be played at Wembley Stadium. All first-leg ties until the semi-finals were played with extra time if level after 90 minutes – first-leg ties may also be resolved with penalties if both teams agree and notify the referee at least 45 minutes before kick-off, per rule 11a of the Rules of the Challenge Vase.
The competition was paused at the semi-final stage due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. The competition resumed in September 2020, but following new restrictions on gatherings in England the final was further postponed eventually being played on 3 May 2021.
