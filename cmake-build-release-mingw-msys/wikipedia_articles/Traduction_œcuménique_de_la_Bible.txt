The Traduction œcuménique de la Bible (English: Ecumenical Translation of the Bible; abr.: TOB; full name: La Bible : traduction œcuménique) is a French ecumenical translation of the Bible, first made in 1975-1976 by Catholics and Protestants.
The project was initiated by Dominicans, and took the form of a revision of the Jerusalem Bible (Bible de Jérusalem). The TOB is published by the Éditions du Cerf and United Bible Societies.
Unlike the Jerusalem Bible, the TOB did not receive an imprimatur.
