The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for having local significance in the themes of architecture, industry, and transportation.  It was nominated for its association with Jenks and the importance of water transportation to the region's foundational lumber industry.


== Description ==
The Jenks House is a one-and-a-half-story brick structure with a two-and-a-half-story tower.  Its distinctive appearance derives from a combination of three architectural styles.  The bracketed square entry bay and cruciform roofline are elements of Italianate architecture while the platform porches, oval stained glass window, and mansard roof on the tower come from Second Empire architecture.  The steep gables, finials, stone window sills and lintels, and detail on the eaves all signal Gothic Revival architecture.
