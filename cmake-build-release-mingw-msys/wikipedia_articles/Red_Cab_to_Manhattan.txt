Unlike his previous two albums, Careless and Bish, none of its tracks nor the album itself cracked the top 100 on the Billboard singles or albums charts. Like his previous albums, Bishop had some big names help on the album. Notable contributors include Eric Clapton, Phil Collins and Art Garfunkel.


== Reception ==

Rolling Stone's Stephen Holden wrote that "[t]he new album is a dazzling breakthrough." Stating that "[o]n Red Cab to Manhattan, Stephen Bishop—pop music's most endearing wimp and an unabashed acolyte of Paul Simon and Paul McCartney—adds Steely Dan to his roster of idols." Noting that "[i]t's been ages since Paul McCartney wrote a love song as fetching as "Don't You Worry"... [a]nd "Red Cab to Manhattan" is as delicately shaded a mood piece as any of Paul Simon's miniatures." Concluding that "[t]hough Stephen Bishop still wears his idols on his sleeve, his sense of humor is unique."
