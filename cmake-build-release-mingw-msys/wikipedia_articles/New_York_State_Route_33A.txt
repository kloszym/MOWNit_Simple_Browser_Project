New York State Route 33A (NY 33A) is an east–west state highway mostly located in Monroe County, New York, in the United States. The route is just over 17 miles (27 km) long and serves as an alternate route of NY 33 between the town of Bergen in Genesee County and the city of Rochester in Monroe County. While NY 33 heads to Rochester by way of Churchville and northern Gates, NY 33A dips south to pass through Chili and southern Gates. NY 33A was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, but only from Riga to Rochester. It was extended westward to its current terminus in Bergen c. 1932.


== Route description ==


=== West of Gates ===
NY 33A begins at an intersection with NY 33 just east of the village of Bergen in the town of the same name. From this point, NY 33 travels to the west and to the northeast while NY 33A heads east. Less than a quarter of a mile (0.4 km) from its western terminus, NY 33A meets Interstate 490 (I-490) at exit 2. In this area, I-490 straddles the border between Genesee County and Monroe County; thus, the westbound portion of the interchange is in Genesee County while the eastbound half is in Monroe County.
