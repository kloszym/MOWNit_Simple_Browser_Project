Macdonald was born in Uniondale, Western Cape in South Africa. His father was of an eye surgeon who came originally from Aberdeen. The family then moved to Australia, where Macdonald received his education at Chatswood Grammar School, near Sydney, New South Wales and the Royal Australian Naval College. During the 1920s, he was a successful wool buyer, and when he came to Britain in the 1930s, he and his brother set up their own business importing Australian fruits. He volunteered for service in 1939, but was turned down, as he had a serious thyroid problem. In 1945, he married the Hon.
