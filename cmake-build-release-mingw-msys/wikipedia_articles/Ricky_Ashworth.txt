Richard David Ashworth (born 17 August 1982 in Salford, England) is a former professional motorcycle speedway rider who represented Great Britain.


== Biography ==
Son of David Ashworth and Mandy Winnard, Ricky was raised in Salford (originally from Irlam) and went to Summerville County primary school and then on to Hope High School. He started his racing career on a Yamaha PW 50cc and Kawasaki K100 as a motocross rider up to the age of 10, changing his bike career to grass track racing after experiencing financial difficulties due to the spiralling cost of privately owning and maintaining motocross bikes.

While gaining a high reputation for himself during his grass track days, Ricky was introduced to speedway. After a couple of practice sessions on a speedway bike he was talent-spotted by Belle Vue Colts. He quickly signed for Premier League side Sheffield Tigers after just 12 months in the sport. He has since gone on to establish himself as a heat leader at the Owlerton club and has also experienced Elite League racing while doubling up with Peterborough Panthers in 2004 and Poole Pirates in 2005.
In 2006, Ashworth was given the number 1 jacket following the retirement of Sean Wilson...
