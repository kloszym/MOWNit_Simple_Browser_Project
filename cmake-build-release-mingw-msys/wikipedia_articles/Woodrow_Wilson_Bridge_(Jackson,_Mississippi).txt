The Woodrow Wilson Bridge in Jackson, Mississippi, is an open-spandrel concrete arch bridge over the Pearl River. It was built in 1925. It was designated a Mississippi Landmark in 1987 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.
It has been demolished and replaced, but a section has been kept and placed as a memorial at an overlook of the Pearl River.
