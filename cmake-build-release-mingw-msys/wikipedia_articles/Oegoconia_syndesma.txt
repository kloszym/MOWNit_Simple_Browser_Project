The wingspan is about 13 mm. The forewings are whitish ochreous sprinkled with dark grey and with a dark fuscous spot on the base of the costa, and irregular elongate blotches before and beyond the middle, suffusedly confluent beneath with the stigmata. The stigmata form cloudy blackish spots, the plical somewhat before the first discal, the second discal transverse. There is a dark fuscous apical blotch, extended as a narrow fascia along the termen. The hindwings are ochreous whitisish.
