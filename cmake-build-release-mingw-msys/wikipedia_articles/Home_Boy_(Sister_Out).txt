== Background ==
In 2018, We Want Sounds described the album:

Recorded at Studio Caroline, a hotbed for the African diaspora in Paris during the 80s, and produced by French-Chilean musician and producer Ramuntcho Matta (his father is Chilean painter Roberto Matta and half-brother is cult New York artist Gordon Matta-Clark), Home Boy, Sister Out is one of Don Cherry's most original albums.
Matta is one of the true architects of that 1980s Paris sound mixing music from all over the Planet with the street vibe of the French capital. He had spent his formative years in Paris and then switched to New York, where he lived between 1978 and 1980, interacting with the cream of the Downtown scene, including Laurie Anderson, Meredith Monk, Peter Gordon, Arto Lindsay, The Talking Heads and many more. Returning to France, Matta started delving into  Paris' hip underground scene led by Actuel Magazine, working and going out with Elli Medeiros, which led to a chance meeting with Don Cherry, and to recording Home Boy in Spring 1985.
