Baron Forteviot, of Dupplin in the County of Perth, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created 4 January 1917 for the Scottish businessman and Liberal Member of Parliament, Sir John Dewar, 1st Baronet. He was Chairman of the Scotch Whisky distilling company John Dewar and Sons and also represented Inverness-shire in the House of Commons. Dewar had already been created a baronet, of the City of Perth, on 24 July 1907. Since 1993, the titles have been held by his grandson, the fourth Baron.
The name Forteviot comes from the historic village, the last Pictish capital of Scotland. Kenneth MacAlpin, King of the Scots, died at Forteviot in 859.
