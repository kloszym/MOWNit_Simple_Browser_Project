She drove in the two-woman event with Jeannette Pennings. Broeders and Pennings appeared on their first Olympics at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. They were named among the possible surprise medalists, but were unable to reach this effort, and finished tenth in the two-woman event.
Broeders finished 14th in the two-woman event at the 2005 FIBT World Championships in Calgary, making her eligible for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.
