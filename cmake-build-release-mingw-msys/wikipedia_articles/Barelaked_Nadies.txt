Barelaked Nadies is the second DVD release from Canadian band Barenaked Ladies, though it is the first full-length release. It is a compilation of their music videos from 1991 to 2002, with one exclusion: the video for the Rock Spectacle version of "Brian Wilson" is missing, and the Gordon version is chronologically in its place. The title of the video is a mashup of the name "Barenaked Ladies". The DVD includes video commentary on each video from the band, recorded at the Four Seasons Hotel in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in July 2002, as well as live concert footage taken from the 2001 Great Guinness Toast pay-per-view. The DVD-ROM also includes a karaoke feature for the song "One Week".
