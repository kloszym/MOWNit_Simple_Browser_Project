Robert Huff (1945–2014) was a painter, printmaker, sculptor and former professor and chairman of the art department at Miami Dade College, Kendall Campus.


== Background and education ==
Huff was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan and moved to Dunedin, Florida at age 11. His family worked within the construction trade and that influenced him from a young age. He attended University of South Florida (USF) initially on an engineering track but after encountering a small Monet painting he switched to art. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1968, then received his Master of Fine Arts from USF in 1968.


== Career ==
Huff arrived in Miami in 1968 and began teaching sculpture art at Miami Dade College, becoming the chair of the department in 1979 until his retirement in 2005. Huff taught various Miami artists who went on to national acclaim such as Robert Chambers, Luis Gispert and Karen Rifas. They were all featured together in Paul Clemence and Julie Davidow's 2007 book, Miami Contemporary Artists.
During his tenure he became a widely-exhibited artist, with over 20 solo exhibits between 1971-2012, and was commissioned for various public art installations in Miami-Dade and Broward County.
