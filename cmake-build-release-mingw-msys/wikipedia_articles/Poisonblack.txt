Poisonblack was a Finnish gothic metal band led by singer and guitarist Ville Laihiala. They released six studio albums.


== History ==
In 2003, the band's first album, Escapexstacy, was on the Finnish national charts for three weeks, peaking at No. 21. They opened for Iron Maiden at the Hartwall Areena in Helsinki on 21 December 2003 for the Dance of Death World Tour.
Singer Juha-Pekka Lepp√§luoto left in the autumn of 2003 to concentrate on his work with Charon. Ville Laihiala, the band's principal songwriter, assumed vocal duties and has since led Poisonblack out of the gothic genre of their first album and in a musical direction that closely mirrors that of his former band Sentenced.
In 2006, the band toured Europe with Lacuna Coil, and their second album, Lust Stained Despair reached No. 2 in Finland for one week.
In 2008, they released A Dead Heavy Day, which hit the Finnish Album Chart in position 6. Following this success, they toured Europe with Dark Tranquillity and Fear My Thoughts. In 2010, Poisonblack released Of Rust and Bones, their fourth album. The fifth album, Drive, was released in 2011 on Hype Records, and the band's latest album, Lyijy, was released in September 2013...
