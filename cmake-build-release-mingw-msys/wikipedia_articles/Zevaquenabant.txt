Zevaquenabant (S-MRI-1867, INV-101, or MRI-1867) is an investigational small-molecule drug, discovered by Dr George Kunos, Dr Resat Cinar, and Dr Malliga iyer at the National Institutes of Health. Zevaquenabant was described as a third generation cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) antagonist due to its peripheral selectivity and polypharmacology. It acts as a peripherally selective inverse agonist of the cannabinoid receptor 1 and an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor. It has been studied in the experimental models of fibrotic disorders such as liver fibrosis[1], chronic kidney disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome pulmonary fibrosis, skin fibrosis, and metabolic disorders such as obesity[2] and dyslipidemia.
