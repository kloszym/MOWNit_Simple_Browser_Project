Shinin' On is the eighth studio album by American rock band Grand Funk Railroad. The album was released in March 1974, by Capitol Records. Although not as successful as its predecessor, We're an American Band (1973), it peaked at #5 in the US and was certified gold, and its first single, a cover of "The Loco-Motion" topped the U.S. charts. The original cover was done in bi-visual 3-D and included the required blue and red lense glasses to view it. The 3D art was done by renowned graphics artist Neal Adams, based on an idea by Lynn Goldsmith and Funk's manager Andrew Cavaliere. Goldsmith worked not only as the band’s photographer, but had also directed the 1973 promotional film for We’re An American Band and created a number of other Grand Funk covers. A Quadraphonic mix of the album was available in the Quadraphonic 8-Track cartridge format. The title song was featured in The Simpsons' 7th season episode "Homerpalooza" on May 19, 1996.
