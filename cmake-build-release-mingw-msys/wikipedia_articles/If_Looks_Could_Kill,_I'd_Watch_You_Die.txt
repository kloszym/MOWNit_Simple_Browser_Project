If Looks Could Kill I'd Watch You Die is the first release by American hardcore punk band Death by Stereo, released in 1999 via Indecision Records. It is highly acclaimed in the hardcore community for its originality and raw sound, tight drumming, lightning fast guitars and tempo changes.  The album is centred on the drums, much more so than their other releases. The introductory track is a sound-bite from the film The Lost Boys, of which the band's name is also derived.
