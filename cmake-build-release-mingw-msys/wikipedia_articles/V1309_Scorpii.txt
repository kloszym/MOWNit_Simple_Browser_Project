V1309 Scorpii (also known as V1309 Sco) is a contact binary that merged into a single star in 2008 in a process known as a luminous red nova. It was the first star to provide conclusive evidence that contact binary systems end their evolution in a stellar merger. Its similarities to V838 Monocerotis and V4332 Sagittarii allowed scientists to identify these stars as merged contact binaries as well.


== Discovery ==
V1309 Scorpii was discovered independently on 2 September 2008 by three groups: Koichi Nishiyama and Fujio Kabashima, Yukio Sakurai, and Guoyou Sun and Xing Gao. It was originally identified as a transient object located near the galactic bulge at right ascension 17h 57m 32.93s ± 0s.01 and declination −30° 43′ 10″ ± 0″.1. The astronomers who found it noted that it had been invisible to their 12 mag limit telescope just a few days prior to its discovery, indicating that it had recently undergone an outburst. Before its eruption, its faintness and close proximity to USNO-B1.0 star 0592-0608962 (magnitude B = 16.9 and R = 14.8) just 1.14″ away made it difficult to detect. When discovered, V1309 Scorpii was believed to be nothing more than a classical nova.
