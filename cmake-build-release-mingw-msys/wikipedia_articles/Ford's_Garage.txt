== History ==
In 2012, co-founders Mike McGuigan, president of McGuigan Restaurant Concepts and Daniel Kearns, President of the Kearns Restaurant Group as well as his son, Zachary Kearns opened the first Ford's Garage restaurant in Fort Myers, Florida.
In May 2013, the company applied to trademark its name as Ford's Garage Venture LLC. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied the application, because the name was too similar to the trademark held by the Ford Motor Company. One year later in 2014, the restaurant chain signed a deal with the Ford Motor Company enabling it to use Ford's trademark "Blue Oval" logo and other insignia in its restaurants.
In 2017, Ford's Garage opened their first restaurant outside Florida in Dearborn, Michigan, the birthplace of the motor company's founder Henry Ford....
