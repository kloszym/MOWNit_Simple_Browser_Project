Docutils can extract comments and information from Python programs, and format them into various forms of program documentation.
In this sense, reStructuredText is a lightweight markup language designed to be both processable by documentation-processing software such as Docutils, and be easily readable by human programmers who are reading and writing Python source code.

The name reStructuredText was chosen to indicate that reST is a "revised, reworked, and reinterpreted StructuredText."
Parts of the reST syntax were inspired by the Setext language from the early 1990s. Elements of the common RFC822 Internet...
