This is a list of earthquakes in 1910. Only magnitude 6.0 or greater earthquakes appear on the list. Lower magnitude events are included if they have caused death, injury or damage. Events which occurred in remote areas will be excluded from the list as they wouldn't have generated significant media interest. All dates are listed according to UTC time. The southwest Pacific Ocean area near New Hebrides and New Caledonia was particularly active this year.
