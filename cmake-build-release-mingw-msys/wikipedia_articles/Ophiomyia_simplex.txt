The asparagus miner  (Ophiomyia simplex Loew; Diptera; Agromyzidae) is a specialist insect that lives on asparagus plants (Asparagus officinalis L.) and is a problem for asparagus growers. It is shiny black and occurs in most major asparagus-producing regions of the world.


== Identification ==
The asparagus miner is a bivoltine stem-mining fly and a major pest of asparagus. It is small (~2â€“5 mm) with a shiny black body and black legs Under a dissecting microscope or with a hand lens, one can confirm the identity of the fly by checking that the costa (the thicker marginal vein) ends at vein R4+5. In addition, the fly has five conspicuous orbital bristles emerging from the middle of its head.  The maggots (immature stages) may be up to 5 mm long, and can be found feeding internally in asparagus stems. They are creamy white in appearance, with the anterior spiracles on short stalks. The pupae are darker brown or reddish, and can sometimes be seen as dried skin from the stem peels back around parts that have been mined.


== Distribution and history ==
