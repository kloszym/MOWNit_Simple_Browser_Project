By the mid-19th century, there was another house approximately on the site of the current building. It was built somewhere between 1866 and 1868 and purchased by Wilhelm (Vilmos) Mühle in 1878. A year after his father's death, in 1909, Árpád will obtain a building permit for a house with a garden, a building that can still be seen today. The Mühle House was designed by the Viennese architect Oskar Reinhart, and the builder was Josef Hofgärtner from Timișoara. Reinhart was related to the famous family of florists from Timișoara, his mother's maiden name being Anna Mühle.
