Sadie Jemmett was born in Cambridge, and had a bohemian, runaway childhood. A major turning point came aged 12 when she discovered music and subsequently taught herself guitar. Between the ages of 14 and 21, Sadie Jemmett played in the bands African Ambassadors, Bridge, Easter Island and, most successfully, Soil. She wrote the music for plays at the Galway Arts Theatre, and toured around Europe, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania with The Rose Theatre (International Touring) Company, writing the music and performing in the show "13 Mirrors" which received 5 star reviews in the Edinburgh Festival.
In 2000, she co-wrote (with DJ Frank Frenzy) the music for 'Résonances', which played at the Theatre d'Atelier, Paris, featuring French film star Irène Jacob and won a Molière award for best new show. An album of the songs from the show sold 3,000 copies in two months through the theatre while the song, "Making Sense", became a playlist favourite on Paris radio station FIP.
In 2001, she co-wrote (again with DJ Frank Frenzy) the music for Faustus...
