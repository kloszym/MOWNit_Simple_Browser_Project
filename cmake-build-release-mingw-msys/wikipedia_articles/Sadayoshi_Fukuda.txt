Fukuda was the pseudonym of Yukiari Segawa (瀬川 行有, Segawa Yukiari), born on 6 April 1917. He studied philosophy at Hosei University (Tokyo), graduating in 1940. In 1944 he was sent to Halmahera; he returned to Japan in 1946. Two years later he started teaching philosophy at his old university, where he would stay until 1970. Thereafter he supported himself by his writing.
Fukuda — the name he used as a teacher as well as a writer — was a prolific author: a hyōronka (critic or pundit) and popularizer of philosophy. He died on 11 December 2002.
