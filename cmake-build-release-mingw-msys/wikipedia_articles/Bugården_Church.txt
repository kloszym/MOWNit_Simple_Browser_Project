== History ==
In the 1970s, planning began for a new church in the northwestern part of the city of Sandefjord. In 1975, an architectural competition was announced for designing the new church. Harald Hille won the competition. Bug책rden church was consecrated by the bishop on 14 December 1980. The new church has seating for about 350 people, but this can be expanded to about 650 with the help of an adjacent parish hall. The brick building has a complex shape and contains space for a wide range of other functions. There is a free-standing bell tower (campanile) next to the church.
