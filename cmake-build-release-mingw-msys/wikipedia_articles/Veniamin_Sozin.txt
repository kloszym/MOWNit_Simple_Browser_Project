Veniamin Innokentevich Sozin (Russian: Вениамин Иннокентьевич Созин, 1896–1956) was a Soviet chess master, writer, and theoretician.


== Chess career ==
Sozin was an active player during the 1920s and 1930s, competing in four Soviet chess championships. Following the third Soviet Championship in 1924, in which he finished a creditable ninth with a score of 9/17, Sozin was awarded the title of Master of Sport; however, he was unable to maintain this level of performance, and was one of several players whose title was revoked in 1935.
Sozin was a noted chess theorist and writer, contributing many articles to the Moscow magazine Shakhmatny Vestnik and writing two books.
