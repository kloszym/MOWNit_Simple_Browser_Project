Dizzywood was an online game and virtual world developed in San Francisco, California by the entertainment company Rocket Paper Scissors, LLC. It is designed for children between the ages of 8 and 14 years old and has a focus on teamwork, cooperation and collaborative play.  The company received funding from well-known investors including Shelby Bonnie (co-founder and former CEO of CNET Networks) and Charles River Ventures.
Dizzywood was launched into public beta in November, 2007 and has grown rapidly, reaching over 400,000 monthly global visitors. Most visitors come from the United States and other English-speaking countries. The game is a visual chat and social game application similar to Club Penguin or Habbo Hotel, with adventure and quest components similar to RuneScape and other MMO games. It was free to play until the introduction of bonuses and extras that required paying to be a "Gold" or "Silver Explorer". The game officially closed December 31, 2010.
