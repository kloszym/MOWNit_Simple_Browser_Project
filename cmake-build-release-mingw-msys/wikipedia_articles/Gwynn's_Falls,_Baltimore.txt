Gwynn's Falls is a neighborhood in the Southwestern District of Baltimore, located between Irvington (west) and Gwynns Falls Leakin Park (east). Frederick Avenue (Maryland Route 144) marks the neighborhood's boundary to the north; Wilkens Avenue (Maryland Route 372) draws its southern edge. Caton Avenue separates it from Irvington to the west.
Before 1977, the neighborhood was known as Carroll Station, for a station of the Pennsylvania Railroad formerly located here. Also known as the Frederick Road station, Carroll Station took its name from Charles Carroll of Carrollton, whose family previously owned the property now occupied by the Gwynn's Fall neighborhood.
