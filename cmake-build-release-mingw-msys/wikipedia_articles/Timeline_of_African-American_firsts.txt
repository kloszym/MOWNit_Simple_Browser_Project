African Americans are an ethnic group in the United States. The first achievements by African Americans in diverse fields have historically marked footholds, often leading to more widespread cultural change. The shorthand phrase for this is "breaking the color barrier".
One prominent example is Jackie Robinson, who became  the first African American of the modern era to become a Major League Baseball player in 1947, ending 60 years of racial segregation within the Negro leagues.
