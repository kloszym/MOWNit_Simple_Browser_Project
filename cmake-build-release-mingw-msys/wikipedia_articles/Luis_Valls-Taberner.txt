=== Early years ===
He was born in Barcelona in 1926, into a family of the Catalan upper middle class with ties to politics, the textile industry, academic teaching and banking. 
Luis was the fifth of six brothers, the youngest of whom, Javier, was co-president of Banco Popular Español with him for years. Two of his other brothers, Pedro and Félix, also worked at the Bank and helped Luis gain access to it by purchasing shares. However, the relative who was decisive in Luis' professional life was Félix Millet i Maristany, his mother's cousin, who was the president of Banco Popular and suggested Luis might replace him at the head of the financial institution.
Luis Valls-Taberner moved to Madrid at the age of twenty-one, where he would end up living the rest of his life. He began working at the Banco Popular de los Previsores del Porvenir, the genesis of Banco Popular Español, of which he would be vice president and president for almost five decades....
