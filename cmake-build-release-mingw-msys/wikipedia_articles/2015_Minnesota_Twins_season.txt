The 2015 Minnesota Twins season  was the 55th season for the franchise in the Twin Cities of Minnesota, their sixth season at Target Field and the 115th overall in the American League. The team finished second in the American League Central with an 83â€“79 record, their best overall result since the 2010 season, which was the last year they made the playoffs.  The team remained in the running for a wild card berth in the American League playoffs until losing Game 161 (their second to last).  They would eventually win a wild card berth two years later, in 2017. In between, however, the team lost 103 games.
After seven years away, outfielder Torii Hunter returned for his twelfth year as a Twin.  Lauded rookies Eddie Rosario, Miguel Sano and Byron Buxton arrived from the minors; each tallied their first big-league hit, home run and run batted in.  In Rosario's case, he did all three on May 6 on the first big-league pitch he saw, just the twenty-ninth player in history to do so. In May, the Twins had a month record of 20-7, which was the best month for the franchise since June 1991, the last year they won the World Series.
