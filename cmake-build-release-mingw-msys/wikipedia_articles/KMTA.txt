KMTA (1050 AM) is a radio station licensed to serve Miles City, Montana.  The station is owned by P&A Media LLC. It airs an oldies format.


== History ==
The station was assigned the KMTA call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on September 23, 1986.
In 2006, Stephen A. Marks' Custer County Community Broadcasting Corporation purchased KMTA and KKRY (92.3 FM) from Senger Broadcasting Corporation for $540,000. Marks already owned KYUS-TV (channel 3) in Miles City; as the television station was a satellite of KULR-TV in Billings, it did not count against the Federal Communications Commission's cross-ownership rules.
Stephen Marks died on May 11, 2022. Andrew Sturlaugson's P&A Media acquired Marks' Montana and North Dakota radio stations, including KMTA and KYUS-FM (the former KKRY), for $850,000 in 2024; the sale separated the radio stations from KYUS-TV, which the Marks estate retained.
