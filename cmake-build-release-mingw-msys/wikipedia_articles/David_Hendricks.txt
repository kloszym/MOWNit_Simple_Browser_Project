David Hendricks is an American businessman convicted of killing his wife and three children in 1984, but acquitted in a retrial in 1991.


== Life ==
David James Hendricks was born in Morton Grove and raised in Oak Park, Illinois. He was a member of the Exclusive branch of the Plymouth Brethren, a Christian denomination. He started and ran a highly successful business in Bloomington, Illinois, selling an orthopedic back-brace he had patented.  He later bought a large house at a then-new development in Bloomington and moved his family there.


== Murders ==
On November 7, 1983, while Hendricks was out of state on a business trip, his wife Susan, 30, and the couple's three children — Rebekah, 9; Grace, 7; and Benjamin, 5 — were found murdered in their Bloomington home by a police officer performing a welfare check, requested after Hendricks was unable to reach them by phone. The murder weapons, consisting of an axe and a butcher's knife, had been left at the scene. Hendricks was interviewed immediately on return from his trip and became the primary suspect due to his relationship with the victims and the police detectives' initial dissatisfaction with his demeanor.
