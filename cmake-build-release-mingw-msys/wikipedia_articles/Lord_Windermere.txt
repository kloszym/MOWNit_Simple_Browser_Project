== Background ==
Lord Windermere is a bay gelding with a white blaze and three white socks bred in Ireland by Edmond Coleman. He was sired by Oscar, a horse who finished second to Peintre Celebre in the Prix du Jockey Club before becoming a leading sire of National Hunt horses. His other major winners have included Big Zeb (Queen Mother Champion Chase), Rock On Ruby (Champion Hurdle), Oscar Whisky (Aintree Hurdle), Peddlers Cross (Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle), Black Jack Ketchum (Sefton Novices' Hurdle) and At Fishers Cross (Spa Novices' Hurdle). Lord Windermere's name is a reference to the Oscar Wilde play Lady Windermere's Fan. His dam, Satellite Dancer, showed no signs of racing ability when being well beaten in all three of her races in 1999.

As a colt foal, Lord Windermere was sent to the Tattersalls Ireland in November 2006 and was bought for â‚¬30,000...
