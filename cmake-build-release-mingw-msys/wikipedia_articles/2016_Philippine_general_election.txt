A general election in the Philippines took place on May 9, 2016, for executive and legislative branches for all levels of government â€“ national, provincial, and local, except for the barangay officials.
At the top of the ballot was the election for successors to Philippine President Benigno Aquino III and Vice President Jejomar Binay. There were also elections for:

12 seats to the Senate;
All 297 seats to the House of Representatives;
All governors, vice governors, and 772 seats to provincial boards for 81 provinces;
All mayors and vice mayors for 145 cities and for 1,489 municipalities;
All members of the city councils and 11,924 seats on municipal councils; and
Governor, vice governor and all 24 seats in the regional assembly of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.
The regional elections for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) were scheduled for May 9, but that would have changed if the Bangsamoro political entity had replaced the ARMM. The ARMM elections pushed through, as scheduled.
Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections were scheduled for October 2016, but were postponed to 2017. Congress postponed anew to barangay elections to May 2018.
