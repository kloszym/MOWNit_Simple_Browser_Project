The thick-billed flowerpecker (Pachyglossa agilis) is a tiny bird in the flowerpecker group. They feed predominantly on fruits and are active birds that are mainly seen in the tops of trees in forests. It is a resident bird with a wide distribution across tropical southern Asia from India east to Indonesia and Timor with several populations recognized as subspecies some of which are sometimes treated as full species. This species was formerly placed in the genus Dicaeum.


== Taxonomy ==
The thick-billed flowerpecker was formally described in 1833 by the English ornithologist Samuel Tickell based on a specimen collected in the Barabhum and Dhalbhum forests of the state of Jharkhand in eastern India. He placed the new species with the finches in the genus Fringilla and coined the binomial name Fringilla agilis. The specific epithet is Latin meaning "nimble" or "active". The thick-billed flowerpecker was formerly placed in the genus Dicaeum but when molecular phylogenetic studies found that this genus was paraphyletic, several species including the thick-billed flowerpecker were moved to the resurrected genus Pachyglossa that had been introduced in 1843 by Edward Blyth.
