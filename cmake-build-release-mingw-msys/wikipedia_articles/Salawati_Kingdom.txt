The Salawati Kingdom is the Islamic kingdom that once stood in Salawati Island, Raja Ampat Regency, Southwest Papua. The center of the Salawati kingdom was located in the Samate village which is currently located in the North Salawati district.


== History ==
The Salawati Kingdom was founded by a king who came from Waigeo namely Fun Malaban or Fun Tusan who is the ancestor of gelet (small clan) Arfan. Salawati is also a vassal kingdom of the Sultanate of Tidore. Although even before the fun arrival from Waigeo, there were already rulers in Salawati with the title of rejao or jaja which meant "landlord" in Ma'ya language. They decided to have a fasyukul pampon (eating contest), which was won by the fun from Waigeo, hence the local rulers submitted to him.
According to Abdullah Arfan's family story, the ancestor of the Arfan dynasty Kalewan, married muballighah Siti Hawa Farouk who came from Cirebon, and changed his name to Bayajid. He is believed to be the first Muslim from Papua and it is estimated that this incident occurred in the 16th century.
Salawati kingdom was one of the tributaries or vassals of Sultan of Tidore. As mentioned the king of Salawati descended from rulers from Waigeo...
