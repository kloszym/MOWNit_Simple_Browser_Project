The leges regiae ('royal laws') were early Roman laws which classical historians such as Plutarch thought had been introduced by the semilegendary kings of Rome.
Though sometimes questioned, scholars of the modern era generally have accepted that the laws or the ultimate sources for them originated early in Roman history, even as early as the period of the Roman Kingdom (753â€“509 BC). In the 20th century, previously unrecognized fragments quoted by ancient writers were identified as leges regiae and attributed or reattributed to the various kings.
The king during Rome's Regal period was a political, military, religious, and judicial chief of the community, though his actual duties might be delegated and entrusted to his auxiliaries.
