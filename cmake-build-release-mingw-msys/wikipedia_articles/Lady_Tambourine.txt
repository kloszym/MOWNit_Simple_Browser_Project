Rosalie Marie Ashton-Washington (born 1957), known as Lady Tambourine, is an American gospel musician from Louisiana, known for her skill at the tambourine.
Washington enjoys impromptu tambourine performances with gospel and zydeco groups, seeking out collaborations and invitations at live shows to join whoever is on stage. She hits the tambourine with her hands, elbows and knees so enthusiastically that she is in the habit of breaking her tambourines, and must carry spares. Funk bandleader Charmaine Neville says that Washington joins her on stage occasionally, "beating the hell out of the tambourine."

Washington was born in Denham Springs, Louisiana, in 1957.

Washington wished that she could play like that. She said later, "It took me years to realize that I had received the gift from heaven..."
At the age of 13, she sang in the local youth choir under director Kenneth Mitchell and then was accepted into the Louisiana All-State Youth...
