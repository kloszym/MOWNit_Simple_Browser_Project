Svetovrachene Glacier (Bulgarian: ледник Световрачене, romanized: lednik Svetovrachene, IPA: [ˈlɛdnik svɛtoˈvrat͡ʃɛnɛ]) is the 7.5 km long and 4 km wide glacier on Brabant Island in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica situated northeast of lower Malpighi Glacier, southeast of Laënnec Glacier and south of Mitev Glacier.  It drains the east and south slopes of Taran Plateau and the south slopes of Avroleva Heights, flows southeastwards between Basarbovo Ridge and Einthoven Hill, and enters Pampa Passage northeast of Bov Point.
The glacier is named after the settlement of Svetovrachene in Western Bulgaria.
