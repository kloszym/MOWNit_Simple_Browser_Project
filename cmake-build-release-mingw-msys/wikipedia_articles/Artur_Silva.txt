Augusto António Artur da Silva (born 1956) is a Bissau-Guinean politician who was the Prime Minister of Guinea-Bissau, appointed by President José Mário Vaz January 30, 2018 to April 16, 2018, to succeed Umaro Sissoco Embaló, who had resigned two weeks earlier.


== Career ==
Artur is a member of the ruling PAIGC Party, and served as education minister in the government of Carlos Gomes Júnior, as well as Foreign Minister. The new Prime Minister's first job will be to organise fresh parliamentary elections in the coming months. But because the PAIGC lost its parliamentary majority, President Vaz sought backing from MPs in the second largest party, the Party of Social Renovation, to secure Silva's appointment.
