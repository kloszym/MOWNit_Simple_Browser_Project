gPotato was a free multiplayer game portal website operated in Japan and South Korea by Gala Inc. and its subsidiaries, and formerly in North America and Europe by subsidiaries of South Korean-based Webzen. gPotato game portals are in South Korea and Japan. Games hosted at gPotato range from traditional MMORPGs to more accessible casual flash games/browser-based games, all of which are free-to-play so no annual/monthly payment is required; revenue is generated from a micropayment system.  Games and their premium item shops can be accessed by the Group's regional gPotato portal sites.   
gPotato games are aimed at a broad range of players.  Gala Inc.'s corporate philosophy is to "connect people all over the world and by doing that, contribute to global peace."  With this in mind, the games published on gPotato portals have no blood in them and are appropriate for a wide age group of players.
gPotato in North America and Europe was previously operated by Gala Inc. In February 2013, Gala-Net, Gala Networks Europe and Gala-Net Brazil were acquired by Webzen. In May 2014 the European and North American gPotato Web sites were merged into the Webzen.com portal.
