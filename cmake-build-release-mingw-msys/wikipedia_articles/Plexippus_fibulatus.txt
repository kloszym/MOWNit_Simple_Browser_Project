Plexippus fibulatus is  a species of jumping spider in the genus Plexippus that lives in Kenya. It was first described in 2016 by Angelika Dawidowicz and Wanda Wesołowska. Only the male has been described. In 2017, Jerzy Prószyński suggested that it should be reclassified in its own genus as it does not resemble other Plexippus spiders but this has not been carried out. It is a medium-sized spider, with a cephalothorax between 2.9 and 3.3 mm (0.11 and 0.13 in) long and an abdomen between 2.9 and 3.3 mm (0.11 and 0.13 in) long. The dark brown carapace is marked with streaks made of white hairs and the brown abdomen has a pattern consisting of a white streak and chevrons. The spider has a short fleshy embolus and a spike-like tibial apophysis, after which is named, that is set perpendicular to the tibia.
