Viscount Bridgeman, of Leigh in the County of Shropshire, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1929 for the Conservative politician William Bridgeman, who had previously served as Home Secretary and First Lord of the Admiralty. He was the son of Reverend John Robert Orlando Bridgeman, third son of George Bridgeman, 2nd Earl of Bradford. His son, the second Viscount, served as Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire from 1951 to 1969. As of 2014 the title is held by the latter's nephew, the third Viscount, who succeeded in 1982. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits as a Conservative.
As descendants of the 2nd Earl of Bradford, the Bridgeman viscounts are in the remainder for that earldom.
