It lies on the B6160 road, between the villages of Grassington and Kettlewell, near Arncliffe and just across the River Wharfe from Conistone. The village is 12 miles (19 km) north of Skipton and 3 miles (5 km) south of Kettlewell.

The crag is around 170 feet high, with an overhang of 40 feet. It was painted by J. M. W. Turner in 1816.
