The 1919 New Hampshire football team was an American football team that represented New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts during the 1919 college football season—the school became the University of New Hampshire in 1923. In its fourth season under head coach William "Butch" Cowell, the team compiled a 7–2 record, while outscoring their opponents by a total of 113 to 29. No opponent scored more than seven points against New Hampshire during the season, and the team won four of its games by shutout. This was the first season that the school fielded a freshman football team, in addition to the varsity.
