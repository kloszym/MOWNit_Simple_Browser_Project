From the late 1950s to the 1970s, State Road 908 was a 13-mile-long (21 km), east–west street in southern Dade County, Florida (now Miami–Dade County). Locally, it was known as Southwest 232nd Street, Silver Palm Drive, and Bailes Road. Its western terminus was an intersection with Country Club Road (Southwest 202nd Avenue) in Redland; its eastern terminus was an intersection with Galloway Road (Southwest 87th Avenue) midway between Cutler Bay and Black Point.  All but 1.3 miles (2.1 km) of SR 908 was on Silver Palm Drive—the section just east of South Dixie Highway (U.S. Route 1) was bypassed by using US 1 and Bailes Drive in Goulds.
