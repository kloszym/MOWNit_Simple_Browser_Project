Jacques Helft (February 26, 1891 - January 9, 1980) was a French art and antiques dealer.


== Early years ==
Born Sem Jacques Helft in 1891 in Paris. His father, Léon Helft, was an antique dealer whose store A la vieille Bretagne was well known. His mother was Hortense Keller.
With his father, Léon, and brother, Yvon, Helft opened a gallery with his brother in a private mansion at 4 rue de Ponthieu (Paris 8e).


== Rosenberg and Helft ==
The art dealer Paul Rosenberg was his brother-in-law. They went into partnership to create a Rosenberg and Helft Gallery in London.
The Paris gallery was seized during the Second World War (with the complicity of the antique dealer Bonnefoy), after Jacques Helft and his family left for New York in September 1940. He escaped France along with his family thanks to the intervention of the Portuguese consul Aristides de Sousa Mendes.
From 1942 to 1948, he had his gallery on 57th Street. Later, from 1948, he moved to Argentina for several years. He returned to France in 1956 and became Honorary President of the Syndicat des Antiquaires.
He was soon led to take an interest in French silverware of the Ancien Régime, a subject that was still very little studied...
