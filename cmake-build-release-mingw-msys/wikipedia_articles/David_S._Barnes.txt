David S. Barnes is an associate professor of history and sociology of science and director of the Health and Societies Program at the University of Pennsylvania. He is a historian specializing in public health issues of Third Republic France.  He argues that the development of public health in nineteenth-century France is best understood in terms of the integration of scientific hypotheses into the generally accepted cultural, social and economic frameworks.
