James D. Lunney (born September 5, 1951) is a Canadian politician. He was the member of Parliament (MP) for Nanaimoâ€”Alberni from 2000 to 2015.
Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, he received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Manitoba in 1972 and a Doctor of Chiropractic from the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in Toronto in 1976. He was first elected in 2000 as a Canadian Alliance candidate, then re-elected in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2011 under the banner of the Conservative Party. He resigned from the Conservative caucus on March 31, 2015, claiming on his blog, "the realm of politics at senior levels" have become hostile to "a Christian world-view", and completed his term in parliament as an Independent MP. He had earlier announced that he would not be standing in the 2015 federal election scheduled for the fall as his constituency is being eliminated due to redistribution.
After practicing chiropractic health care in Kitchener, Ontario, for approximately 15 years, the Lunneys relocated to Vancouver Island, where James established West Coast Chiropractic in Parksville and practiced for another 9 years.
