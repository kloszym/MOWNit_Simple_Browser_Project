Khosrow Ghobadan and Ridak (Shah Khosrow and Ridak) also known as Khosrow and Ridag (خسرو و ریدگ),  is work of Middle Persian literature in Pahlavi with details about Sassanian culture in the era of Khosrow II (known as Khosrow Parviz (خسرو پرویز) in the story).
In the story, a young man called Ridak (ریدگ) stands before the king seeking a position. He is asked 13 questions by the king. Ridaki is less a name than a description of position; it meant a servant or a young boy who served the elders and nobles. His answers form the treatise.
At the beginning of Ridak's treatise, he describes to Khosrow Parviz that he was from a prosperous family and that his father had died at a young age and his mother more recently. However, due to his father's inheritance, he was able to go to school (academy) and obtain the necessary religious information and become a teacher, and then become skilled in riding, shooting, spearing, music, astronomy, and various games. After this introduction, he asks the king to test him, and the king asks thirteen questions about the best foods and fruits and what they ate, songs, flowers and perfumes, and women and horses, etc., and all his answers are to his liking...
