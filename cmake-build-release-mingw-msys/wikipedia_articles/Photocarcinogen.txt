A photocarcinogen is a substance which causes cancer when an organism is exposed to it, then illuminated.  Many chemicals that are not carcinogenic can be photocarcinogenic when combined with exposure to light, especially UV.  This can easily be understood from a photochemical perspective: The reactivity of a chemical substance itself might be low, but after illumination it transitions to an excited state, which is chemically much more reactive and therefore potentially harmful to biological tissue and DNA.  Light can also split photocarcinogens, releasing free radicals, whose unpaired electrons cause them to be extremely reactive.
The type of UV radiation determines the characteristics of photocarcinogenesis. For example, UVA radiation characteristically gives rise to reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide whereas UVB radiation correlates with CPD lesions. The ROS are produced when endogenous photosensitizers are stimulated by UVA radiation. DNA absorption of UV radiation primarily leads to CPD and 6-4 lesions. The neighboring pyrimidines form a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer in a CPD lesion. DNA absorption of UV radiation can also lead to TC, CC, and TT lesions but...
