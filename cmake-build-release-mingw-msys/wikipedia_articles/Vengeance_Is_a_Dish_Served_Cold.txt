== Plot ==
Jeremias was 12 years old when an onslaught on his parents' ranch made him an orphan. He has fought Indians ever since because he considers them responsible for this atrocity. One day, he captures Tune, a young squaw in the wilderness. He brings her to the next city because he plans to sell her as a slave to the highest bidder. Before she is passed on to a buyer, a racist mob tries to lynch her. Jeremias foils this attempts but is taken by surprise later on. Two bandits abduct Tune and leave Jeremias for dead. As soon as he has recovered sufficiently he pursues the misdoers. When he gets at them, it turns out they are associated with a so-called friend of his late father. Jeremias discloses that this presumed friend did not only deceive George Bridger, but also his son Jeremias. The murderers of the Bridger family have been his henchman who had been ordered to mask themselves as Indians.
