After graduation, Fletcher launched his urban menswear brand, Daniel w. Fletcher. Before starting his label, he gained experience from a handful of internships at James Long in London and Lanvin and Louis Vuitton in Paris. In 2015, Harry Styles was his first client, buying all of the boxy short-sleeved shirts he had made for his graduate collection. He made all of his shirts an inch longer for Styles, and they have remained that length ever since. Throughout his final year at university, Fletcher also worked at Victoria Beckham, which helped him finance and execute his label as well as through brand sponsorships from Saga Furs and Inditex.
