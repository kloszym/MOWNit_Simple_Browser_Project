Access to safe drinking water in Pakistan remains a serious challenge, with only 36% of the country's water supply deemed safe for consumption. Despite having a 92% water supply coverage, over 70% of households use bacterially contaminated water, leading to widespread waterborne diseases. In flood-affected areas, more than 10 million people still rely on unsafe sources like ponds and wells. The issue contributes to the deaths of over 53,000 children under five each year due to diarrheal illnesses. Urban areas are not immune, as 61% of water sources in major cities like Karachi and Multan are unsafe for drinking.
