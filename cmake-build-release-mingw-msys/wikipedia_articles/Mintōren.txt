The Young Koreans Against Ethnic Discrimination in Japan (Japanese: 民族差別と闘う連絡協議会), abbreviated as Mintohren or Mintōren, is a grass-roots movement created by young Koreans in Japan ("Zainichi Koreans") to combat ethnic discrimination by encouraging a multicultural and positive approach to integration of Koreans into Japanese society.
The movement started in the 1970s as a joint effort of three groups: Mukuge no Kai, founded by Lee Kyung-jae in 1972 in Osaka, Tokkabi Kodomo Kai, founded in 1974 in Osaka, and Seikyu Sha, founded in 1974 in Tokyo. In 1985, they began a campaign in Takatsuki, Osaka Prefecture which resulted in the establishment of a division in the city board of education devoted exclusively to education for ethnic Koreans, and the elimination of the requirement that city employees hold Japanese nationality. They also played an important role in the 1980s struggle against the requirement that all foreign residents, including Special Permanent Residents like the Zainichi Koreans, give their fingerprints to police; they organised refusers from different parts of Japan, as well as providing information and increasing awareness of their campaign.
