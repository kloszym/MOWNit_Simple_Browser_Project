Year 241 (CCXLI) was a common year starting on Friday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known  as the Year of the Consulship of Gordianus and Pompeianus  by the Romans (or, less frequently, year 994 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 241 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
