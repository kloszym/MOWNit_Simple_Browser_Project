Miles Davis and Milt Jackson Quintet/Sextet, also known as Quintet/Sextet is a studio album by the trumpeter Miles Davis and vibraphonist Milt Jackson released by Prestige Records in August 1956. It was recorded on August 5, 1955. Credited to "Miles Davis and Milt Jackson", this was an "all-star" session, and did not feature any of the members of Davis's working group of that time. Alto saxophonist Jackie McLean appears on his own compositions “Dr. Jackle” and “Minor March”.


== Background and recording ==

After the release of Blue Moods, a collaboration with Charles Mingus on which Davis only participated to pay back fees to Mingus, Davis recorded with his new band in New York's Café Bohemia. That band included the young Sonny Rollins (tenor saxophone) as well as the rhythm section of pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Philly Joe Jones, whom Davis retained for the Miles Davis Quintet (with tenor saxophonist John Coltrane). This album’s August sessions did not feature Davis’ current working band, but an "All Star" lineup, with Milt Jackson (vibraphone), bassist Percy Heath and drummer Art Taylor. Davis also hired pianist Ray Bryant, because he wanted a bebop sound...
