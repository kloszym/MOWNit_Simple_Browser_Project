GlenAllachie distillery is a Speyside, single malt whisky distillery at Aberlour founded in 1967, which sits at the foot of Ben Rinnes.
Previously, the distillery produced whisky mainly for blends; it has, however, since been relaunched as a distillery known for its fruity, single malt expressions.
