The Rheinmetall Mk 20 Rh-202 (short for Maschinenkanone 20 mm Rheinmetall) is a 20 mm caliber autocannon designed and produced by Rheinmetall. It fires the 20×139mm ammunition originally developed for the Hispano-Suiza HS.820.
The cannon is used on German military vehicles, including the Marder infantry fighting vehicle, the Spähpanzer Luchs and some variants of the Wiesel AWC. It is used in the Argentinian VCTP, an IFV based on the TAM chassis. A towed twin mount antiaircraft version was produced and used by Argentina in the Falklands War.
German naval ships also employed Rh 202 mounts, usually two on frigates and destroyers, four on larger replenishment ships. They have been or are currently being replaced with the new Mauser, now a subsidiary of Rheinmetall, MLG 27 remote-controlled guns of 27 mm calibre.
A version modified to fire the U.S. M50 series of 20×102mm ammunition loaded into the M14 link belt has been offered to no avail for the U.S. Government by Maremont Corporation, of Saco, Maine, licensed by Rheinmetall under marketing arrangement.
