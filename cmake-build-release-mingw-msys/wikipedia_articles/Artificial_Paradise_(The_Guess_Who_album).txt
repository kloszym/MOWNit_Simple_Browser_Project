Artificial Paradise is the tenth studio album by the Canadian rock band The Guess Who. It was released by RCA Records in 1973. This was the first album by the group to feature bassist Bill Wallace.
Musically, Artificial Paradise finds The Guess Who showcasing a variety of styles: rockers ("Orly", "All Hashed Out," "Rock and Roller Steam"), ballads ("Samantha's Living Room," "Lost and Found Town"), and even world music ("Hamba Gahle-Usalang Gahle").
The album is likely best remembered for its record jacket and inner sleeve, which is an extensive lampoon of direct mail advertising. The cover mentions The Guess Who only in passing.

In addition to the usual 2 channel stereo version the album was also released by RCA in a 4 channel quadraphonic version on 8-track tape.


== Reception ==
AllMusic's Joe Viglione: "Artificial Paradise may be the most consistent album project by the post-Randy Bachman Guess Who, a solid offering of strong melodies, superb production, and focused artistic vision. (Despite the memorable cover artâ€”or, perhaps, because of it) ...did much to sink this fine effort."
The album peaked at number 102 on the Billboard 200 in March 1973.
