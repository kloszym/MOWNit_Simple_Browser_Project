Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is a class of anticoagulant medications. They are used in the prevention of blood clots and, in the treatment of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), and the treatment of myocardial infarction.
Heparin is a naturally occurring polysaccharide that inhibits coagulation, leading to thrombosis. Natural heparin consists of molecular chains of varying lengths or molecular weights. Chains of varying molecular weights, from 5000 to over 40,000 daltons, make up polydisperse pharmaceutical-grade heparin. LMWHs, in contrast, consist of only short chains of polysaccharides. LMWHs are defined as heparin salts having an average molecular weight of less than 8000 Da and for which at least 60% of all chains have a molecular weight less than 8000 Da. Various methods of fractionation or depolymerization of polymeric heparin obtain these.
Heparin derived from natural sources, mainly porcine intestine or bovine lung, can be administered therapeutically to prevent thrombosis. However, the effects of natural or unfractionated heparin are more unpredictable than LMWH.
