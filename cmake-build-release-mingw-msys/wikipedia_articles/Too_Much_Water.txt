"Too Much Water" is a song written by George Jones and Sonny James. Jones released it as a single on the short-lived Mercury-Starday label in 1957, and it became a hit, peaking at No. 13 on the charts. Like most of Jones's singles to this point, "Too Much Water" was an up tempo honky tonk number in the Ernest Tubb-Hank Williams tradition, although with a slight rockabilly edge. The song was included on the 1957 LP 14 Top Country Favorites.
