Telegraph Media Group Limited (TMG; previously the Telegraph Group) owns The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph and is a subsidiary of Press Holdings. David and Frederick Barclay acquired the group on 30 July 2004 from Hollinger Inc. of Toronto, Canada, the newspaper group controlled by Conrad Black, after months of bidding and lawsuits.
In 2015, TMG's operating profit was £51 million. According to unaudited accounts leaked to The Guardian, profits before tax were £47 million, and turnover for the 53 weeks up to 3 January 2016 was £319 million. These figures indicate an increase from 2014 levels.
In 2023, TMG acquired The Chelsea Magazine Company, publisher of magazines including Classic Boat.

In June 2023, the group was put up for sale after its parent company, B.UK, a Bermuda-based holding company, entered receivership. Howard and Aidan Barclay were removed as directors.
