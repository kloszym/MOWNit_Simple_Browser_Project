== History ==
Baringa is situated in the Gubbi Gubbi (Kabi) traditional Aboriginal country.  The name Baringa comes from the Gubbi-Gubbi language and means summit or little mountain.
The locality of Baringa was excised from Bells Creek on 18 August 2017. It was created to accommodate residential population growth in the Caloundra South Priority Development Area. The first residential land sales commenced in August 2016 with the expectation of homes being occupied from 2017. Baringa is part of a $5 billion master-planned community being developed by Stockland and is expected to accommodate 50,000 people after 30 years.
Baringa State Primary School opened in 2018 on the highest point in the residential area. The school had an initial capacity of 470 students with plans to accommodate 1,100 students within its first 5 to 8 years. The founding principal was Noel Baggs. The school was designed to have an emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
