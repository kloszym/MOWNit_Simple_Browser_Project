Ghabdellatif (Volga Türki and  Persian: عبداللطیف; c. 1475 – after 1502) was the Khan of the Kazan Khanate from 1496 to 1502.
Ghabdellatif was the youngest son of Ibrahim of Kazan and Nur Soltan. When Ghabdellatif's father died in 1479, his mother married Meñli I Giray and relocated to the Crimean Khanate. Around 1490 Meñli I Giray sent Ghabdellatif to Muscovy for service, where he received the town of Zvenigorod, while his brother Moxammat Amin ruled Kashira. This was considered a great honor because these towns were usually given to the sons of the Grand Duke of Muscovy.
After a 1495 coup against the pro-Muscovy Moxammat Amin, the khan Mamuq quickly discredited himself. Ghabdellatif was chosen as a weaker alternative to his brother Moxammat Amin with Moscow's approval.
In 1499 another attempt was made to restore the Siberian dynasty to the throne of Kazan. Uraq attempted to establish Agalaq as Kazan khan, but the attempt was repelled.
Ghabdellatif grew up in the Crimean Khanate, which had closer ties with the Ottoman Empire than with Muscovy. As he became older, he started to conduct more independent politics, which was unacceptable to the faction which selected him for the throne...
