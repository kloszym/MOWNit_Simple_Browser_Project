Ray Charles Live is a double LP compilation album by Ray Charles, released by Atlantic Records in 1973.  
It consists of live concert recordings previously released on Ray Charles at Newport and Ray Charles in Person (recorded at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1958 and at Herndon Stadium in Atlanta in 1959, respectively).  Later CD re-issues of this compilation include an additional, previously unreleased, track from the 1958 Newport concert, "Swanee River Rock".
