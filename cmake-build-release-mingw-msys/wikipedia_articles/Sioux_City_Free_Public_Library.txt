The Sioux City Free Public Library is a historic building located in Sioux City, Iowa, United States.  The library was located in a section of the Municipal Building, no longer extant, between 1892 and 1913.  It had outgrown the space when the Library Board contacted Andrew Carnegie in 1910 about providing the funding for a new library building.  Their request was initially turned down.  They chose to work with New York City architect Edward L. Tilton, an architect preferred by Carnegie, in place of local architect William L. Steele who was working with the board previously.  Local resident George Murphy donated the property for the new building.  Meanwhile, Tilton designed the two-story brick  Renaissance Revival building.  On April 8, 1911, Carnegie approved the project and donated $75,000 for the building's construction.  The new building was dedicated on March 6, 1913, and it is considered "an excellent early twentieth century example of the architectural development of library planning and design."  It was Tilton's only building in Iowa.
Plans were made to enlarge the building in 1938, but the bond issue failed.  The library remained in its cramped quarters until 1989 when it moved...
