== History of Centenary ==
The origins of the Company can be traced back to 1901 and the forming of a ladies' choral society, which was augmented by a drama group in 1904.  By 1907 the Operatic and Dramatic Society took the form seen today, with the Crosfield family taking a very active part.  The Societyâ€™s first full-scale musical was in 1907 with the presentation of Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury.
