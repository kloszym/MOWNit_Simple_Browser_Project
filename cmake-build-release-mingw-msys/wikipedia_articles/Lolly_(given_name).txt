Lolly is a hypocorism for various given names, including the English name Laura. Young children often have difficulty in pronouncing the letter r, which resulted in nicknames like Lolly that substitute the letter l for r. Other examples include Dolly for Dorothy,  Hallie for Harriet, Molly or Polly for Mary, and Sally for Sarah.
