Rustaveli (Georgian: რუსთაველი) is a station of the Tbilisi Metro on the Akhmeteli–Varketili Line (First Line). It is located at Rustaveli Square at the northern end of Rustaveli Avenue next to the Shota Rustaveli statue. The station was opened on 11 January 1966 as part of the original metro line with six stations, which include stations from Didube to Rustaveli. 
The metro station is named after Shota Rustaveli, a great Georgian poet and thinker of the 12th century, the author of The Knight in the Panther's Skin, a Georgian national epic poem.
Located between Tavisuplebis Moedani and Marjanishvili stations, Rustaveli is 60 metres underground, and with an escalator length of 120 meters or 394 feet, making the station the deepest of the Tbilisi metro system and one of the deepest in Europe.  Because of this, per some sources, the Rustaveli metro station has the world's 6th longest escalator.
Other attractions and sightseeing near the station include the Georgian National Academy of Sciences, First Republic Square, Rustaveli Avenue, and Tbilisi Concert Hall.
