Fairmount Park is a park in Riverside, California, designated by the Riverside Cultural Heritage Board as Landmark No. 69. The park's band shell, designed in 1920 by Mission-style architect Arthur Burnett Benton, is separately designated as Landmark No. 10. The park is located at 2601 Fairmount Boulevard, and lies SouthEast of the Santa Ana River with Route 60 to the North.
The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a safe eating advisory for any fish caught in Lake Evans, in the Western portion of the park, due to elevated levels of mercury and PCBs. In addition, there is a notice of "DO NOT EAT" for Catfish.


== History ==

The firm Olmsted and Olmsted was commissioned in 1911 to design Fairmount Park. Although Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed New York City's Central Park, had died in 1903, his design principles were evident in his sons' planning of Fairmount Park. The primary design aspects of the park were implemented over the following 13 years, ending in 1924 with Lake Evans. In 1985, a tree inventory showed that many of the trees in the reforesting effort from 1911 were still living.
