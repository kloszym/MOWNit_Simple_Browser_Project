The 1902 Turkestan earthquake (also known as the Artush or Kashgar earthquake) devastated Xinjiang, China, near the Kyrgyzstan border. It occurred on August 22, 1902, at 03:00:22 (09:00:22 local time) with an epicenter in the Tien Shan mountains. The thrust earthquake measured 7.7 on the moment magnitude scale (Mw ) and had a depth of 18 km (11 mi).
The Tien Shan mountains is situated in a zone of complex convergence caused by the Indian–Eurasian plate interaction. This zone is actively deforming—accommodated by active thrust faults responsible for seismic activity. The mainshock was preceded by an intense series of foreshocks in the years prior. Many aftershocks followed, several were larger than magnitude 6.0 and the largest measured 6.8–7.3. Aftershocks were recorded for three years. Additional shocks were recorded over a decade after the mainshock.
An estimated 5,650–10,000 people were killed in the mainshock. Widespread destruction occurred—at least 30,000 homes were destroyed. Shaking was felt across an area of 927,000 km2 (358,000 sq mi). The effects of the earthquake led government officials to relieve victims of taxes and provide compensation.
