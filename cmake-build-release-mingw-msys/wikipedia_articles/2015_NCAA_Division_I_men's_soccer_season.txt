The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), created for the 2015–16 school year with the merger of the University of Texas–Pan American (UTPA) and University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB), added the sport to the Division I athletic program it inherited from UTPA. Although UTB had a highly successful NAIA men's soccer team, the UTRGV program was created essentially from scratch, with an entirely new coaching staff and only two UTB players remaining in the UTRGV program. UTRGV also inherited UTPA's membership in the Western Athletic Conference.
