The Angstrom exponent or Ångström exponent or absorption Ångström exponent is a parameter that describes how the optical thickness of an aerosol typically depends on the wavelength of the light.


== Definition ==
In 1929, the Swedish physicist Anders K. Ångström found that the optical thickness of an aerosol depends on the wavelength of light according to the power law
