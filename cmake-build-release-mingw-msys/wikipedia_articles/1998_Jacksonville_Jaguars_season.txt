The 1998 season was the Jacksonville Jaguars' 4th season in the National Football League (NFL) and their 4th season under the leadership of general manager and head coach Tom Coughlin. The team equaled the 11–5 record from their previous season, but won their first division title, as both the Tennessee Oilers and Pittsburgh Steelers lost crucial games near the end of the regular season. In the playoffs the Jaguars won their Wild Card game versus the New England Patriots, 25–10, but lost the following week in the Divisional round against the New York Jets, 34–24.
The Jaguars appeared twice on Monday Night Football, winning both games.
