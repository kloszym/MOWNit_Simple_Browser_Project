The New York Times crossword is a daily American-style crossword puzzle published in The New York Times, syndicated to more than 300 other newspapers and journals, and released online on the newspaper's website and mobile apps as part of The New York Times Games.
The puzzle is created by various freelance constructors and has been edited by Will Shortz since 1993. The crosswords are designed to increase in difficulty throughout the week, with the easiest on Monday and the most difficult on Saturday. The larger Sunday crossword, which appears in The New York Times Magazine, is an icon in American culture; it is typically intended to be a "Wednesday or Thursday" in difficulty. The standard daily crossword is 15 by 15 squares, while the Sunday crossword measures 21 by 21 squares. Many of the puzzle's rules were created by its first editor, Margaret Farrar.
