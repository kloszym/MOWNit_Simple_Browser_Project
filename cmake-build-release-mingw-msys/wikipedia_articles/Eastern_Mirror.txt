== History ==
On 16 November 2015, Eastern Mirror along with four other state newspapers—Capi, The Morung Express, Nagaland Page and Tir Yimyim published their front page in blank to protest against a diktat from the Assam Rifles. The Assam Rifles had earlier in October ordered the editors to stop covering the rebel group—National Socialist Council of Nagaland - Khaplang (NSCN-K).
