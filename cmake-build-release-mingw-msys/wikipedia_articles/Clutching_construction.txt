In topology, a branch of mathematics, the clutching construction is a way of constructing fiber bundles, particularly vector bundles on spheres.


== Definition ==
Consider the sphere 
  
    
      
        
          S
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S^{n}}
  
 as the union of the upper and lower hemispheres 
  
    
      
        
          D
          
            +
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle D_{+}^{n}}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
          D
          
            −
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle D_{-}^{n}}
  
 along their intersection, the equator, an 
  
    
      
        
          S
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S^{n-1}}
  
.
Given trivialized fiber bundles with fiber 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
  
 and structure group 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  
 over the two hemispheres, then given a map 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        
          S
          
            n...
