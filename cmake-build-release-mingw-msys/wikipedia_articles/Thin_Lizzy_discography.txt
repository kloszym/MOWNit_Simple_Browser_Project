The following is a discography of Thin Lizzy, an Irish hard rock band formed in Dublin in 1969. Originally led by frontman, bass guitarist, songwriter and singer Phil Lynott, their most commercially successful songs are "The Boys Are Back in Town", "Whiskey in the Jar" and "Jailbreak", all major international hits still played regularly on hard rock and classic rock radio stations.
Lynott dissolved Thin Lizzy in 1983, and died in 1986. Several former members reactivated the band in 1994. The current line-up of Thin Lizzy restrict themselves to playing the band's classic material live, and use the name Black Star Riders for recording and performing new material. Thin Lizzy still perform on an occasional basis and the most recent line-up consisted of longtime guitarist Scott Gorham, keyboardist Darren Wharton, and four other members who were not present during the band's main recording career.
