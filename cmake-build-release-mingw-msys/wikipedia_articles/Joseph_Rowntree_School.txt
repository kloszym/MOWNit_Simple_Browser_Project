== History ==
The Joseph Rowntree Village Trust maintains the model village of New Earswick, built by the Quaker organisation. It is analogous to Bournville and the Cadbury family, who were also Quakers. The village of Earswick is on the other side of the A1237 and the river, to the north-east. The primary school opened in 1912. Built when the area was in the North Riding Local Education Authority, the school opened on 12 January 1942 to serve the Flaxton Rural District, comprising nineteen villages. It was officially opened on 7 July 1942 by Rab Butler. It had a capacity for 480, based on class sizes of 40. It covered 14 acres (57,000 m2) and built in West Huntington Park. From 1944, it was proposed to make the school bi-lateral, with a technical school section of the school intake.
In 2016, the school was successfully sued for Â£180,000 due to disabled discrimination of a former employee.
