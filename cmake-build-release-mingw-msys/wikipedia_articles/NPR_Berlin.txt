NPR Berlin was the first international affiliate of the American public radio network, NPR. The station started broadcasting in April 2006. It replaced a radio station from Voice of America that previously broadcast on the 104.1 MHz frequency. The affiliate was operated by NPR Media Berlin gGmbH, a German nonprofit organization of which NPR is the sole shareholder. NPR Berlin was in the unique position of being the only NPR affiliate with a broadcast area outside the United States.

A web stream launched on 2 August 2010 and ended on 2 October 2017.
