Between 1996 and 2002, the National Health Service in England and Wales was organised under health authorities (HAs). There were 95 HAs at the time of their abolition in England in 2002, and they reported to the eight regional offices of the NHS Executive. They generally covered groups of one or more complete local authority districts (LADs), but there were cases where LADs were split.
They were established in 1996 by the Health Authorities Act 1995. They took on the functions of the abolished district health authorities (DHAs) and family health services authorities (FHSAs).
There were five HAs in Wales, reporting to the National Assembly. The HAs were divided into a total of 22 local health groups (LHGs), one in each of the Welsh unitary authorities. These HAs and LHGs were abolished when the Welsh NHS was restructured on 1 April 2003.
The HAs in England were themselves divided into Primary Care Organisations (PCOs) created in 1999. When PCOs were first established, there were 481 primary care groups (PCGs). However, by 2002, a significant number had converted to primary care trusts (PCTs). The numbers of both HAs and PCOs varied slightly until 2002.
In 2002, the HAs were abolished...
