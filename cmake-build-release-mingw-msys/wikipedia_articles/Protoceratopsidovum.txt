Protoceratopsidovum is an oogenus of dinosaur egg from Mongolia. Despite its name (which means "eggs of Protoceratops"), it does not represent the eggs of a protoceratopsid, but rather the eggs of maniraptoran theropods.


== Description ==
Protoceratopsidovum eggs are extremely abundant in the Djadokhta and Barun Goyot Formations. P. sincerum and P. minimum eggs both have a smooth surface, whereas those of P. fluxuosum have fine ornamentation around the equatorial part. The eggs are elongated and asymmetrical, with a two-layered prismatic shell generally resembling the eggs of Troodon. They were laid in pairs.


== Parataxonomy ==
The eggs of Protoceratopsidovum are classified in the oofamily Prismatoolithidae. They were originally thought to be eggs of Protoceratops (hence the name) because they are extremely common at the same sites as Protoceratops. However, more recent research has cast doubt on this: a cladistic analysis in 2008, by Zelenitsky and Therrien, found them to be the eggs of maniraptorans.


== Palaeobiology ==
The shape, structure, and arrangement of eggs of Protoceratopsidovum and its relatives provide some insight into the palaeobiology of fossil eggs. Their asymmetrical...
