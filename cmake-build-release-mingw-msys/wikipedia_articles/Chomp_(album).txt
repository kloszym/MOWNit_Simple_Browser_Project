Chomp is the second studio album by Athens, Georgia band Pylon, released in 1983. It was re-released in 2009 via DFA Records.


== Critical reception ==
Trouser Press called the album "more ambitious in scope" than the debut, writing that it "incorporates a psychedelic drone in spots" and that the band "sometimes sounds less anxious and strident than before." The Stranger deemed Chomp an "essential [record] of angsty new wave and piquant post-punk."
