It is operated by Rede Voa.

On December 1, 1997, the facility was internationalized albeit with restrictions: only maintenance ferry flights are permitted with previous arrangements set with the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil.
Taking advantage of its international status TAM Airlines (now LATAM Brasil) acquired the old tractor plant and after a complete renovation installed one of its maintenance centers on the site. This facility provides services to not only LATAM but also other airlines.
In 2002, with the closure of the former São Carlos Airport (ICAO: SDZC), which was closer to town, the resident São Carlos Aero Club was transferred to Mário Pereira Lopes Airport.
