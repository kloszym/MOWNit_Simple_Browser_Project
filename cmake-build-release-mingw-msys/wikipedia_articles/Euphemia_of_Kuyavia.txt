Euphemia of Kuyavia (c. 1265 – 18 March 1308) was a Kuyavian princess and Queen consort of Galicia-Volhynia.
She was the daughter of Casimir I of Kuyavia by his third wife Euphrosyne, daughter of Casimir I of Opole. Euphemia was sister of Władysław I the Elbow-high, the wife of Yuri I of Galicia, and the mother of Andrew of Galicia and Lev II of Galicia.
The only preserved evidence of Euphemia's existence is from Jan Długosz's Yearbooks, which reported that Euphemia died on 18 March 1308. She was the daughter of Prince Casimir and the wife of Yuri I, who died in the same year on 21 April, which was also his birthday.

=== Birth ===
Her parents' marriage was concluded in mid 1257, and her father died on 14 December 1267. Thus, Euphemia soon after the wedding. Literature puts her birth at around 1265. In the absence of sources of an accurate date of birth, it is not possible to determine when Euphemia was born.
It is most likely that Euphemia was named after her aunt, Euphemia of Greater Poland. There is also a possibility, though less likely, that she received her name from a daughter of Swantopolk II, Duke of Pomerania because her father tried to make peace with him....
