Sjair Abdoel Moeloek (شَعِيْر عَبْدُالْمُلُوْك; Perfected Spelling: Syair Abdul Muluk) is an 1847 syair (poem) credited variously to Raja Ali Haji or his sister Saleha. It tells of a woman who passes as a man to free her husband from the Sultan of Hindustan, who had captured him in an assault on their kingdom.

Syair Abdul Muluk has seen several reprints and translations. It is often adapted to the stage, and was the basis for Lie Kim Hok's Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari.
