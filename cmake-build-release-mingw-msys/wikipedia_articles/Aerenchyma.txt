Aerenchyma or aeriferous parenchyma   or lacunae, is a modification of the parenchyma to form a spongy tissue that creates spaces or air channels in the leaves, stems and roots of some plants, which allows exchange of gases between the shoot and the root. The channels of air-filled cavities (see image to right) provide a low-resistance internal pathway for the exchange of gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide and ethylene between the plant above the water and the submerged tissues. Aerenchyma is also widespread in aquatic and wetland plants which must grow in hypoxic soils.
The word "aerenchyma" is Modern Latin derived from Latin aer for "air" and Greek enkhyma for "infusion."


== Aerenchyma formation and hypoxia ==
Aerenchyma (air-filled cavities) occur in two forms. Lysigenous aerenchyma form via apoptosis of particular cortical root cells to form air-filled cavities. Schizogenous aerenchyma form via decomposition of pectic substances in the middle lamellae with consequent cell separation.
When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland...
