Mirakel (Miracle) was the 2020 Sveriges Television's Christmas Calendar. It started airing on 1 December 2020, and ended on 24 December the same year.


== Plot ==

In a laboratory in Sweden before Christmas 2020, the scientists Anna-Carin Davidsson-Colt and Vilgot develop an artificial black hole to be used as an energy source. The black hole is accidentally released and ends up in the attic of an residential care home for children where the orphan Mira lives. Mira is soon to be adopted, but does not want to be separated from her friend Galad.
Exactly 100 years earlier (in 1920) and in the same building, then a mansion, the upper-class girl Rakel Colt is getting ready to be photographed with her family. Mira and Rakel both stumble upon the black hole and are involuntarily pulled in by it, switching bodies and time periods.
To raise awareness of global warming, Christmas of 1920 is depicted as snowy while in 2020, there is no snow on the ground.
