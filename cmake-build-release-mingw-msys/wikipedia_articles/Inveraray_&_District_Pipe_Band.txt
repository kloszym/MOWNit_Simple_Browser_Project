Inveraray and District Pipe Band is a Grade 1 pipe band based in Inveraray, Scotland.


== History ==
Stuart Liddell, a native of Argyll and one of the world's top solo players began coaching youngsters at Inveraray Primary School in 2003, and registered the band in 2005 with the RSPBA. Liddell believed the community could support a thriving competitive pipe band, even though the region's last pipe band had disbanded in the 1930s.
The band's first competition was at the 2005 Cowal Gathering. Using borrowed drums and their own kilts, the group finished 13th of 19 in the Novice Juvenile division. In 2006, the band finished in the top 6 at all major competitions in Novice Juvenile, and in 2007 won 4 out of 5 majors and the Champion of Champions award. In 2008, the band won the World Championships, Cowal Championships and Champion of Champions in the Juvenile division, and were promoted to Grade 2.
In 2009, the band won all five major Grade 2 contests (Scottish, British, European, World and Cowal Championships), and were promoted to Grade 1.
In 2010, the band's first year in Grade 1, they placed 8th in the Scottish Championships, 7th in the British Championships, 8th in the European Championships...
