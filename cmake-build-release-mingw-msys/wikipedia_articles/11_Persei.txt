11 Persei is a single star in the constellation of Perseus, located about 418 light years away from the Sun. It is visible to the naked eye as a dim, blue-white hued star with an apparent visual magnitude of 5.76.
This is a chemically peculiar mercury-manganese star. Cowley (1972) found a stellar classification of B7 III(p?) (Hg?), while Hube (1970) had B8 IV, and Appenzeller (1967) showed B6 V. Stellar models indicate this is a young B-type main sequence star with an estimated age of around 51 million years. It has a low rotation rate, showing a projected rotational velocity of 4.50 km/s. The star has 3.8 times the mass of the Sun and is radiating 210 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 14,550 K.
