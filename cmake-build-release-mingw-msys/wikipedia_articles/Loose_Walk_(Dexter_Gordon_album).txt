== Critical reception ==

JazzTimes reviewer Chris Kelsey stated "Gordon’s playing is loose and relaxed, bluesy and intense. Drew is superb; NHOP and Riel do their duty. Dex’s idiosyncratic spoken intros to tunes like “I Should Care” and “Come Rain or Come Shine” are charming, and the gritty soulfulness of his playing reminds us just how much we miss the greats of his generation. They don’t make ’em like this anymore".
