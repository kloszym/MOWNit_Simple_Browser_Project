Silver Patriarch (8 May 1994 â€“ 11 October 2009) was a racehorse, winner of the 1997 St Leger and of seven other races. He was ridden by Pat Eddery in all but three of his races.
The horse was bred in Ireland, by Saddlers' Hall and out of the American horse Early Rising, but was trained in Britain by John Dunlop.  After winning two of his four starts as a two-year-old, at Newmarket and Pontefract, he finished third in the Sandown Classic Trial at Sandown Park in April 1997, before winning the Lingfield Derby Trial and being touched off by a short head by Benny the Dip in an extremely tight finish to the 1997 Epsom Derby.  He would go on to have a more successful career than the horse who beat him, who would not win any of his three subsequent races.
Silver Patriarch started favourite for the 1997 Irish Derby, but finished a disappointing fifth to Desert King, beaten thirteen lengths.  He then came second to Stowaway in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York, beaten half a length, before winning the St Leger at Doncaster, for which he had started 5-4 favourite.
As a four-year-old he finished a narrow second to Romanov in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket, but won the 1998 Coronation Cup...
