The Unterberger test, also Unterberger's test and Unterberger's stepping test, is a test used in otolaryngology to help assess whether a patient has a vestibular pathology.  It is not useful for detecting central (brain) disorders of balance.


== Technique ==
The patient is asked to walk in place with their eyes closed.


=== Interpretation ===
If the patient rotates to one side they may have a labyrinthine lesion on that side, but this test should not be used to diagnose lesions without the support of other tests.
