In linear algebra, a power cone is a kind of a convex cone that is particularly important in modeling convex optimization problems. It is a generalization of the quadratic cone: the quadratic cone is defined using a quadratic equation (with the power 2), whereas a power cone can be defined using any power, not necessarily 2.

The n-dimensional power cone is parameterized by a real number
