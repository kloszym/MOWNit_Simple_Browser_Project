== Synopsis ==
Captain America teams up with Doctor Druid to investigate the disappearance of John Jameson, formerly the superhero Man-Wolf. Their investigation takes them to a town overrun by werewolves controlled by Dredmund the Druid, where Captain America skirmishes with the werewolf-hunting Moonhunter and a brainwashed Wolverine. Captain America is then captured by the supervillain Nightshade, who transforms him into a werewolf. 
"Capwolf" finds that he has been captured alongside superheroes with werewolf-like powers, such as Jameson, Wolfsbane, and Werewolf By Night, and leads them to defeat Nightshade. They then face Dredmund, and destroy the magical stone that gives him his powers. Captain America is then suddenly attacked by a doppelganger of himself, whom he defeats after he is given an antidote mid-battle that cures him of his lycanthropy.
