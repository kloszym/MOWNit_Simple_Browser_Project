Pieces of a Dream is a greatest hits album by American singer Anastacia. It was released on November 7, 2005, by Epic Records. The album includes singles from her first three studio albums, Not That Kind (2000), Freak of Nature (2001), and Anastacia (2004), as well as four new songs (two duets and two solo songs) and a megamix of her greatest hits. Only two of Anastacia's singles—"Boom", the official 2002 FIFA World Cup anthem, and "Love Is a Crime", from the soundtrack to the 2002 film Chicago—were omitted from the album, but are included as remixes on the special edition of the album.
In April 2007, Pieces of a Dream re-entered the UK Albums Chart at number 74. The album was reissued on October 17, 2008, containing the same track listing and new artwork.
