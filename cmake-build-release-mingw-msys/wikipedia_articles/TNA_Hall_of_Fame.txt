The TNA Hall of Fame is a hall of fame that honors professional wrestlers and wrestling personalities who contributed to the history of the American based professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).
It was established in 2012, and created as part of the celebration of the promotion's 10th anniversary. Inductees are usually announced at either the Slammiversary pay-per-view event or on episodes of TNA Impact!, and the ceremony takes place prior to Bound for Glory. It has been an annual tradition for TNA since 2012 with the exception of two years (2017 and 2019).
As of 2024, there have been 16 inducted in total; 12 individually, and two group inductions.
