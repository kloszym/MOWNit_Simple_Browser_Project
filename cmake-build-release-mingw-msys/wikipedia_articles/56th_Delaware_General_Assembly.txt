The 56th Delaware General Assembly (1832â€“1833) was a meeting of the legislative branch of the state government, consisting of the Delaware Senate and the Delaware House of Representatives. Elections were held the first Tuesday of October and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. It met in Dover, convening January 3, 1832, two weeks before the beginning of the third year of the administration of Governor David Hazzard.
The apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not effect the number of delegates. Both chambers had a National Republican majority.
