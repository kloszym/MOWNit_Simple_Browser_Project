Aluminium selenide is the inorganic compound with the formula Al2Se3.


== Preparation ==
It is a solid prepared by igniting a mixture of the elements at 1,000 °C (1,830 °F):

2 Al  +  3 Se  →   Al2Se3
The pure compound is white, but typical samples are coloured.  Samples are usually protected from moisture, because they hydrolyze readily, giving off highly toxic hydrogen selenide gas:

Al2Se3  +  3 H2O   →   Al2O3  +  3 H2Se


== Use ==
Al2Se3 has been used as a precursor to hydrogen selenide, which is released when the solid is treated with acids.
