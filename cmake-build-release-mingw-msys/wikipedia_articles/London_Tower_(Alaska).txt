London Tower is a 7,550 ft (2,300 m) mountain summit located in the Alaska Range, in Denali National Park and Preserve, in Alaska, United States. It is situated on the east side of the Ruth Gorge, 15.23 mi (25 km) southeast of Denali and 3.38 mi (5 km) south of The Moose's Tooth. Mount Bradley rises 2.55 miles (4.10 km) directly across The Great Gorge to the west. Despite its relatively low elevation, it is notable for its west face with over 3,000 feet of vertical granite.


== Climate ==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, London Tower is located in a Tundra climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and cool summers. Weather systems are forced upwards by the Alaska Range (orographic lift), causing heavy precipitation in the form of snowfall. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °F with wind chill factors below −30 °F. The months May through June offer the most favorable weather for viewing and climbing.
