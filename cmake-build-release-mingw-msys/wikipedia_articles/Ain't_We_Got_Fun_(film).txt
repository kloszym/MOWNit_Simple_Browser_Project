Ain't We Got Fun is a 1937 Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Tex Avery. The cartoon was released on May 1, 1937. The title is based on the popular song of the same name.
This is one of a rare handful of Warner Bros. cartoons (which also include "The Night Watchman", "We, the Animals - Squeak!", "Scaredy Cat", "Claws for Alarm" and "Kiss Me Cat") in which the cats are depicted as the heroes and the mice as the villains rather than vice versa.


== Plot ==
The plotline concerns a cat who is tricked by a group of fun-loving mice into taking the blame for the mess they created and getting thrown out of the house into the snow by his cantankerous old owner. The mice then do a song routine of the title song, and have taken over by the time the old man realizes what is happening. The old man begs the cat to come back and take care of the rodent problem, but the cat, pride wounded, stubbornly refuses and remains in the snow. When the mice in the house taunt him, "You are a fraidy cat! Ha, ha, ha!", the cat's pride can only be satisfied by rushing back into the house and chasing the mice into the snow, at which point the old owner acts kindly to the cat.
