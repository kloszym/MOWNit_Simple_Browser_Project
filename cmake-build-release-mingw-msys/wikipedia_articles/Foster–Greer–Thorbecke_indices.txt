The Foster–Greer–Thorbecke indices are a family of poverty metrics. The most commonly used index from the family, FGT2, puts higher weight on the poverty of the poorest individuals, making it a combined measure of poverty and income inequality and a popular choice within development economics. The indices were introduced in a 1984 paper by economists Erik Thorbecke, Joel Greer, and James Foster.
The individual indices within the family are derived by substituting different values of the parameter α into the following equation:
