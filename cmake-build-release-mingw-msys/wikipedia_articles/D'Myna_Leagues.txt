D'Myna Leagues is a Canadian animated television series, which aired on CTV from 2000 to 2004. Loosely based on the baseball writing of W. P. Kinsella, the series was set in a world populated by anthropomorphic birds, and centred on the minor league baseball team in the town of Mynaville. The baseball games were represented by placing two-dimensional characters in three-dimensional backgrounds. The teams of bird characters were opposed by rival teams like the Weasels, the Pigs, the Beavers and the Elephants.
The series was created by the Vancouver-based Studio B Productions.
In the United States, the series aired on The WB 100+ Station Group. The show is distributed internationally by Sony Pictures Television.
