Podonectria is a genus in the monotypic Podonectriaceae family of fungi. They are parasitic fungus on scale insects, other fungi, or on substrates that had previously colonized by other fungi.
The family of Podonectriaceae was introduced to accommodate genus Podonectria by Dao et al. in 2016. This was later confirmed by ITS and LSU data.


== Description ==
They generally have a sexual morph that has a byssoid (wispy, cottony or teased wool appearance) stromata which is well-developed or scant and white to brown or dark-brown. The ascomata is solitary or aggregated, superficial on or immersed in the stroma. It is globose to subglobose, obpyriform or ovoid in shape, cream white to light yellow, or brown to dark brown in colour and covered with hairs or absent. The hamathecium (i.e., all of the fungal hyphae or other tissues between asci) consists of numerous reticulate, filiform, septate and branched  pseudoparaphyses. The asci is 8-spored, bitunicate (double walled) and long clavate to cylindric in shape. The ascospores are long clavate to long cylindric, or vermiform in shape. They are also multiseptate. 
The species in the genus also have an asexual morph that is tetracrium-like. The...
