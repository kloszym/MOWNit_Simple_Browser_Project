== History ==
Research and development began in 1967 and detailed design in the early 1970s, with a first land launch 30 April 1982 and a sea launch from a Project 629A (Golf-class)  submarine on 12 October 1982. The general designer of the missile was Huang Weilu, and Chen Deren (Chinese: 陈德仁, 1922 – 21 December 2007) served as his deputy. The missile was assembled at Factory 307 (now Nanjing Dawn Group [南京晨光集团]).
The JL-1 was deployed on Xia class submarine in 1986. The Type 092 Xia class nuclear submarine has 12 launch tubes.
The JL-1 was initially tested and deployed on the PLAN's modified Golf class SSB. The Golf has since been modified again for further testing of other missiles, such as the JL-2, which has test-launched multiple times with varying levels of success.
The DF-21 appears to be a land-based version of the JL-1. As of 2018, the JL-1 and its warheads are believed...
