Arterivo Wakayama (アルテリーヴォ和歌山, Aruterīvu~o Wakayama) is a football (soccer) club based in Wakayama, the capital city of Wakayama Prefecture in Japan. They play in the Kansai Soccer League, which is part of Japanese Regional Leagues. The name Arterivo comes from the combination of two Italian words: arte, meaning "art", and arrivo, meaning "arrival".


== History ==
They started with 30 volunteers to establish a J. League club: their final goal started in July 2007, when Arterivo Wakayama was officially registered as a football club. From 2008, Arterivo started climbing the Japanese football pyramid, reaching Kansai Soccer League in 2011, while getting their spot in Division 1 just the next season. They won Kansai Soccer League both in 2015 and 2016, but they're still waiting for a Japan Football League promotion.
Over the years, Arterivo has competed in various Emperor's Cup matches. Out of fifteen attempts, they have managed to advance to the second round or beyond on three separate occasions.
