DMS-59 (Dual Monitor Solution, 59 pins) is generally used for computer video cards. It provides two Digital Visual Interface (DVI) or Video Graphics Array (VGA) outputs in a single connector. A Y-style breakout cable is needed for the transition from the DMS-59 output (digital + analogue) to DVI (digital) or VGA (analogue), and different types of adapter cables exist. The connector is four pins high and 15 pins wide, with a single pin missing from the bottom row, in a D-shaped shell, with thumbscrews.  As of December 2020, this adapter cable was listed as obsolete by its primary vendor Molex.
The advantage of DMS-59 is its ability to support two high resolution displays, such as two DVI Single Link digital channels or two VGA analog channels, with a single DVI-size connector. The compact size lets a low-profile card support two high resolution displays, and a full-height card (with two DMS-59 connectors) up to four high resolution displays.
The DMS-59 connector was used by e.g. AMD (AMD FireMV), Nvidia and Matrox for video cards sold in some Lenovo ThinkStation models, Viglen Genies and Omninos, Dell, HP and Compaq computers. DMS-59 connectors also appeared on Sun Computers. Some confusion...
