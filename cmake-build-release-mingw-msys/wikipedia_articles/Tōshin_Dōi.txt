"Tōshin Dōi" (Okinawan: 唐船ドーイ, lit. 'A Chinese ship is coming') is an Okinawan folk song. It is a popular eisa song and is typically played at the end of Okinawan music festivals.
In the 14th century, the Ryukyuans became a tributary state of China, causing extensive trade to occur between the Ryukyu Kingdom and the Ming dynasty. "Tōshin Dōi" was often performed when Chinese ships arrived in Okinawa to trade with locals.


== Lyrics ==
There are many variants of "Tōshin Dōi", with singers choosing their own verses beyond the first. The first verse remains the same across all versions, and describes the grandfather of a man from Wakasamachi village (若狭町村) named Shinafa (瀬名波). While the rest of the village is excited by the arrival of the Chinese ships and run off to the port of Nafa (Naha), Shinafa's grandfather remains calm and does not run. It is left to the singer to explain why Shinafa's grandfather remains calm in the subsequent lyrics.
