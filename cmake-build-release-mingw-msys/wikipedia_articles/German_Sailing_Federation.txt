The German Sailing Federation (German: Deutscher Segler-Verband, DSV) is the national governing body for the sport of sailing in Germany, recognised by World Sailing.


== History ==

In 1888 the German Sailing Association was founded as the first chairman Adolpf Burmester. At the offices of the Norddeutscher Regatta Verein (North German Regatta Association) in Hamburg met as official founding clubs: Norddeutscher Regatta Verein, Kaiserlicher Yacht Club (Imperial Yacht Club), Verein Seglerhaus am Wannsee (Wannsee Sailors House Association), Segelclub Rhe (Sailing Club Rhe – Königsberg), Berlin Sailing Club, Berlin Regatta Club, Academic Sailors Club (Berlin), Spandauer Yacht-Club, Berlin Yacht Club, Hamburg Elbsegel Regatta Association, and St Georger Segel Verein (St George Sailing Association – Sankt Georgen an der Gusen). In the year 1933 the DSV was subject to Gleichschaltung. At the same time the Freier Segler Verband (Free Sailors' Association), founded in 1901 by workers was renamed and later wrapped up. 1934 saw the liquidation of the Deutscher Seglerbund (German Sailors' Federation) DSB, by which the DSV became the only sailing association in Germany.
