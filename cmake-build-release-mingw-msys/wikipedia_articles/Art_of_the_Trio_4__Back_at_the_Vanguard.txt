== Reception ==

AllMusic awarded the album 4Â½ stars and in its review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine, he states "as this exceptional album proves, there is considerable emotion and feeling and plain excitement behind his music, even during the mesmerizing quiet sections". On All About Jazz, John Sharpe noted "Mehldau and his trio have changed and evolved since his early recordings and have now established their own, unique voice". JazzTimes reviewer, Josef Woodard commented "It's a live affair in more ways than one, full of the detours and shameless explorations on-the-fly that Mehldau is wont to make in the course of jazz duty. Mehldau's debt to the re-inventive impulse, and the classical instincts, in Keith Jarrett's playing are still identifiable, but his personal voice keeps emerging afresh".
