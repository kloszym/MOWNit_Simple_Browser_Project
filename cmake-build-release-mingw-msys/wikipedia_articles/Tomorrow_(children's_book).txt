Tomorrow is a children's book written and illustrated by Syrian author Nadine Kaadan. It was originally published in 2012 by Box of Tales Publishing House (Arabic) and was later published in 2018 by Lantana Publishing (English). The story follows Yazan, a young boy living in Syria at the start of the Syrian civil war and the confusion and uncertainty of what is going on around him. Aware of the changes in his life, Yazan is frustrated and leaves his house without his parents knowing only to find the streets empty and filled with frightening sounds. He returns home and his mother explains that it is too dangerous outside, and he must not leave. Instead, they paint a park in his bedroom until he can go out again.
Written to help understand conflict, Kaadan reflects on her experience dealing with the Syrian crisis and her mission to empower children through "inclusive representation." Tomorrow not only helps children understand big emotions that come with conflict but exposes them to a world outside of their own. Her book has won several awards including the USBBY Outstanding International Book award, Sakura Medal longlist, Middle East Book Award honorable mention, and Little Rebels Award...
