The Trinity Chronicle (Russian: Троицкая летопись, romanized: Troitskaya letopis', abbreviated TL, Tro, or T) is a Rus' chronicle written in Church Slavonic, probably at the Trinity Lavra near Moscow by Epiphanius the Wise (died 1420).


== Manuscript ==
The manuscript of the Trinity Chronicle may or may not to have contained a 'Short Redaction' of the Kulikovo Chronicle Tale. The Chronicle ended with Edigu's invasion of 1408. Its tendenz has been tentatively described as pro-Muscovite and pro-Cyprian. The text appears to have been an early 15th-century copy of a text that was close to the Laurentian Codex of 1377. The Trinity Chronicle was often cited by 18th-century historians. 
The only known manuscript was lost in the fire of Moscow in 1812.


== Priselkov reconstruction ==
After its destruction in 1812, the text was partially reconstructed by Mikhail D. Priselkov (posthumously published in 1950) from quotations in Nikolay Karamzin's History of the Russian State (1816–1826) and in the 1804 critical edition of the Laurentian Codex by Chebotarev and Cherepanov, which only reached the year 906. The published reconstruction, however, contains much speculative borrowing from other chronicles...
