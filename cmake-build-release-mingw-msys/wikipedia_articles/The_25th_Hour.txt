The 25th Hour is the 2001 debut novel by David Benioff.  A film adaptation, for which Benioff wrote the screenplay, was directed by Spike Lee and released in 2002.


== Background ==
The idea for the book came when Benioff returned home to New York for Passover while he was away working in Wyoming. He suffered from appendicitis and had to undergo emergency surgery.  Benioff said: "Walking the halls of Mount Sinai afterward, seeing people walking up 5th Avenue and Central Park and trapped in the hospital, I had a sense of being so close to the city and not being a part of it." He continued: "I thought, 'What if you are not stuck for five days, but seven years?' And that is writing what you don't know. Taking a banal problem and making it much more serious."
Benioff spent two years writing the novel, and completed the book as his thesis for a Master of Fine Arts degree in creative writing at the University of California Irvine in 1999. The book was originally titled Fireman Down, but was changed to The 25th Hour on the advice of the publisher who accepted the book with a $7,500 advance. The book was published in 2001.
