Franz Goeschke (German spelling, Göschke); (1844 – 1912) was a German horticulturist who was director of horticulture and head of the Royal Prussian Pomological Institute in Proskau. His father, Gottlieb Göschke (1818-1898), was also a noted horticulturalist.
Franz Göschke was a leading authority of strawberry cultivation. He is credited with creating around thirty new varieties of strawberry, including the once popular Erdbeere Königin Luise (Queen Luise strawberry), a variety he first introduced in 1905.
