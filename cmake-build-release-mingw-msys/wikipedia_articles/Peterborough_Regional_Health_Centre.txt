Peterborough Regional Health Centre (PRHC) is a tertiary care hospital located in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. The hospital was established in January 1999, and it is a combination of the former Peterborough Civic Hospital and St. Joseph's Health Centre. All acute care services were provided at 1 Hospital Drive (the former Civic Hospital), located in the Central-West part of the city, while chronic, rehabilitation and palliative care services, along with some out-patient medical and surgical services, were provided from the 384 Rogers Street site (the former St. Joseph's Health Centre) located in the "East City" or Ashburnham neighbourhood of Peterborough. Effective June 2008, all services of the PRHC (excluding some Outpatient Mental Health services and the Women's Health Care Centre) moved into a new 715,000 sq ft (66,400 m2) hospital building located directly in front of the old Civic Hospital across from the Nicholls Building, which continued to house some Outpatient Mental Health services (including the Schizophrenia Clinic, Family & Youth Clinic, and Psychiatric Services for the Elderly) until 2010.
In late 2010, all patient services were moved into the new hospital building...
