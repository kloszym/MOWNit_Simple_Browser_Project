Lipaphis erysimi is a species of aphid of the family Aphididae. Its common names include mustard aphid and turnip aphid. It is found in most temperate and tropical areas of the world and feeds only on cruciferous plants. The insects are almost exclusively female and are very prolific, with wingless females producing around one hundred young during a lifespan of a few weeks.

The antennae are dark, the legs are pale with dark joints and the cornicles are pale with dark tips. The body is faintly dusted with a white powder.
