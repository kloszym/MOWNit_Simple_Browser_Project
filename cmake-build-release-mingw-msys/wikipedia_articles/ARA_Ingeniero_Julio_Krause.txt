Ingeniero Julio Krause was an oil tanker originally ordered by the Argentine oil company YPF (Yacimientos Petrol√≠feros Fiscales) in the early 1980s, designed and built by the Argentine ASTARSA shipyard, at Buenos Aires, Argentina. The design allowed the ship to operate in both littoral and fluvial service.
Ingeniero Julio Krause had a steel single-bottom hull and the superstructure at the stern, with a single tripod mast and a large single funnel atop, behind the bridge; the cargo area was located in the middle of the ship and comprised 15 liquid cargo tanks with a capacity of 8,350 cubic metres (52,500 bbl) served by three pumps, each able to transfer 500 m3 (3,100 bbl)/hour.
Ingeniero Julio Krause was powered by one eight-cylinder Sulzer 8 ZL 40/48 4T SA marine diesel engine of 4,300 kilowatts (5,800 hp) at 550 rpm, driving one variable-pitch propeller; with a maximum speed of 14.5 knots...
