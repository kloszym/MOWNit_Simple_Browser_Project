== Biography ==
Passovoy was born in Paterson, New Jersey. She was ahead of her time in the early 1960s, both on the court and in life. Her tennis skills earned her a place in collegiate tennis history and a place in her school's sports history as a female who competed on the 1963 men's tennis team at Orange State College (now known as California State University, Fullerton) and lettered on the team in her senior class year. At the time she was a married mother of three children. Passovoy remains the only female in the school's sports history to letter on a male varsity sport's program at the school. She accomplished this by beating players

There was no Titans' women's tennis team until three years later when the program began in 1966. If Passovoy wanted to play, it had to be on the men's tennis team. The team's number one singles player that year was Mike Bouck who had transferred after playing one year of collegiate tennis at UCLA for legendary Bruin head coach J.D. Morgan...
