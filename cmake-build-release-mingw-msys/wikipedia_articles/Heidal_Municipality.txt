== History ==

The municipality of Heidal (originally spelled Hedalen) was established on 1 January 1908. On that date, the large Vågå Municipality was divided into three parts: the northeast part became Sel Municipality (population: 2,287), the southeast part became Heidal Municipality (population: 1,241), and the western part remained as Vågå Municipality (population: 2,953). 
During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, the municipality of Heidal (population: 1,731) was dissolved and it was merged with the municipality of Sel (population: 3,687) plus the Tolstadåsen area of Vågå (population: 35) and the Sjoa area of Nord-Fron (population: 413) to form a new, larger Sel Municipality...
