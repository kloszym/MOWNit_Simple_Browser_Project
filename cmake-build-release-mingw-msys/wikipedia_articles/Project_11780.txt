Project 11780 Kherson was an unrealized 1980s Soviet LHD program derived from the Kiev-class aircraft carrier design comparable to the US Tarawa-class amphibious assault ship. The ship would have been about 25,000 tons displacement, with steam turbine power plants and carried about 12 helicopters and four Ondatra-class landing craft or two Tsaplya-class LCACs.

The development of the Project 11780 began when Admiral of the Fleet of the USSR Sergey Gorshkov ordered the development of a fully-fledged universal landing ship. The design and purpose of the ship evolved throughout the development. Initially, the ship was intended solely for landing operations. Then the General Staff proposed turning the Project 11780 ships into universal aircraft-carrying ships by equipping them with a bow ski-jump ramp, allowing the deployment of helicopters to bolster the air support for the landing troops.
It was planned to build two ships: "Kherson" and "Kremenchuk". The pair would have a standard displacement of 25,000 tons, making it only could be built at the Chernomorsky Shipyard. At that time, the slipways of the Black Sea Shipyard were scheduled for the construction of Project...
