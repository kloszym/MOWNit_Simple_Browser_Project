=== Early history ===
The church was originally constructed in 1080, as a small chapel on the hill. It was dedicated to St Mary the Virgin.  The Abbot of St Albans consecrated it and he became both Patron and Rector until the Reformation. After the Reformation, the church's rector was appointed by the reigning monarch â€“ a practice which continues to this day.
The first chapel had thick walls made of compressed rubble, lime and plaster with stone around the openings. The windows had no glass.  Much of the north wall is from that time. The frame of the door on the south side is probably also from that same period. The chapel might have had an apse.
