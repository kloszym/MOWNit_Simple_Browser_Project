Siphonarioidea is a taxonomic superfamily of air-breathing sea snails or false limpets, marine gastropod mollusks in the clade Panpulmonata.


== Distribution ==
The Siphonarioidea are broadly distributed across the globe, however they are known to be the most abundant and species diverse in the warmer temperate to subtropical regions. More specifically, they are found within the southern hemisphere of the Indo-Pacific region. They generally inhabit marine benthic regions, specifically the subtidal zones.


== Description ==
Siphonarioidea are almost entirely marine organisms, as they have been found to have evolved into despite the terrestrial ecosystems inhabited by their ancestors. They inhabit the subtidal zones of marine ecosystems, and resemble true limpets with their non coiled, conical shells. Siphonarioidea are frequently referred to as "false limpets" due to some distinct differences despite their resemblance to these Patellogastropoda. For example, Siphonariid adults' dorso-ventral muscles have a C-shape pattern and surround the central mantle cavity, which contrasts to the U-shaped muscles of patellogastropods. Siphonarioidea have a singular lung on the right side of their bodies...
