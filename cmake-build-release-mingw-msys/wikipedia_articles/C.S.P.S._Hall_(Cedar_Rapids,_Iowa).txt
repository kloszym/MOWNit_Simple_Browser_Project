The C.S.P.S. Hall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, USA was built during 1890-91 and expanded twice in the next two decades.  It was a social and cultural center of the local Czech-Slovak Protective Society (C.S.P.S.).  The building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.  In 2002 it was included as a contributing property in the Bohemian Commercial Historic District.
The C.S.P.S. was an organization that began with offering a kind of insurance to members.  The first lodge of the C.S.P.S. in Cedar Rapids was founded in 1879 and there were three by 1882.
The building is a local adaptation of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture.
The building was damaged in the 2008 flooding of Cedar Rapids, but underwent a major renovation in 2011 that preserved its historic character.
Beginning in 1992, the building was used by Legion Arts, a nonprofit organization, to offer visual art displays, theatre, and concerts. This mission was taken over in 2020 by a new non-profit called CSPS Hall.
