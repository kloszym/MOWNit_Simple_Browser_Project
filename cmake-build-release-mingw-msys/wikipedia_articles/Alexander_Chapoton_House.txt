== Alexander Chapoton ==

Alexander Chapoton was a descendant of one of the oldest Detroit families. His ancestor Jean Chapoton was a surgeon in the French army, and was assigned to Fort Pontchartrain, arriving in 1719. Jean remained in Detroit until his death in 1762.
Years later, Jean's descendant Alexander Chapoton inherited his father Eustache's masonry business and a fortune to go along with it. He later expanded his business and became an important contractor in Detroit, helping to build several commercial blocks and residences, including the Globe Tobacco Building. He also served on the Water Board and was appointed to a commission that selected an architect for the Michigan state capitol. Chapoton's son, Alexander Jr., joined the family business and eventually inherited a greater fortune than his father had.
Chapoton built this house in the late 1870s as rental property. However, Chapoton himself lived in the home until his death in 1893.
