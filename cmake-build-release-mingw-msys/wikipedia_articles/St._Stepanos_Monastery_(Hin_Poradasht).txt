St. Stepanos Monastery was an Armenian monastery located in Julfa District of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan. The monastery complex was located approximately 1.6 km northwest of abandoned Hin Poradasht village.

The monastery complex consisted of a main church and 12 to 15 auxiliary buildings enclosed within a perimeter wall that reached 6 to 8 m high. The church was a vaulted structure with a single nave and a five-sided apse with vestries on either side. Armenian inscriptions were set into the western facade and in the interior.
