Eastern Sierra Transit is the operator of public transportation for the Eastern Sierra Region in California (between the Sierra Nevada and the California state line). The agency operates both inter-city and local service. They also offer Dial-a-ride service to disabled passengers in all service areas and to the general public in areas where there is no scheduled fixed-route service. The Eastern Sierra Transit Authority was established in 2006 and took over the operations of Inyo Mono Transit in 2007.
