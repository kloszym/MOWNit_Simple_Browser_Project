The earliest East India Company records of Casa Verona go back to 1665â€“70, during the Agency of Sir Edward Winter when he is mentioned as a partner of Beri Timmanna. After Timmanna's death, Verona obtained a virtual monopoly over Madras trade. He was on extremely friendly terms with agents Winter and later Sir William Langhorne, 1st Baronet.
