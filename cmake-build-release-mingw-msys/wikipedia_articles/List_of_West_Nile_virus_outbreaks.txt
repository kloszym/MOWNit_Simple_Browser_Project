In the first three years only a small number of human cases were diagnosed, all in the Eastern or Southern U.S. (149 cases and 19 deaths, 1999â€“2001). In 2002, the disease exploded to most of the lower 48 states, causing 4,156 diagnosed cases of which 284 died. The disease continued to spread, reaching all but three states by 2006. The first case detected in Maine occurred in 2012.  The single cases detected in Hawaii in 2014 and in Alaska in 2018 were likely imported.
In the period from 1999 to 2018, the United States had 2,330 total deaths out of 50,830 diagnosed cases, giving a case fatality rate of 5%. The worst years were 2003 for the most cases with 9,862 and 2012 for the most deaths with 286. Most cases are thought to go undiagnosed. The WHO claims that about 80% of cases are asymptomatic.
