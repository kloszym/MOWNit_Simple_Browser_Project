Nick's Original Big Train Bar was a New Orleans saloon originally established as a grocery in 1918 by Nicholas G. "Mr. Nick" Castrogiovanni (1893–1979).  Located at 2400 Tulane Avenue across the street from the Dixie Brewing Company, Nick's Bar operated until Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005.  The bar was opened after Prohibition ended. The business grew to include the bar, an Italian grocery and delicatessen, liquor store, and beer garden.  In September 1965 Hurricane Betsy damaged the property and only the bar remained.
Mr. Nick was well known in New Orleans as "a mixologist."  He was best known for the Pousse-Café, in which liqueurs are layered by specific gravity, and he was known to have layered 34 different liqueurs in a small Pousse-Café glass.  (The challenge in pouring a Pousse-Café would be to do so slowly, to assure that liqueurs "stack" and do not mix.)
The bar was called the "Big Train" because Nick was known to purchase liquor by the trainload in the 1930s, at a time when other bars didn't do so.  A mural depicting a fast-moving train, modern for the time and passing a "Dixie 45" road sign, presided over the bar.
Mr. Nick developed a reputation as a raconteur and showman...
