Cue Ball Wizard is a pinball machine designed by Jon Norris and released in December 18 1992 by Gottlieb. It features a cue sports theme and was advertised with the slogan "Gottlieb Presents CUE BALL WIZARD!".


== Description ==
Cue Ball Wizard has a two and three ball Multiball and an oscillating captive ball kicker at the upper playfield. Its most noticeable feature, a full-sized captive cue ball that can be used to hit two elevated targets, is placed below on the lower playfield.
The ramp is the game's most important shot, as it has to be hit once to light it up for the wagon wheel award. In the wagon wheel are all the modes the player must finish to reach Pool Ball Mania.
