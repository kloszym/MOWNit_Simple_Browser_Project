== Premise ==
Evan Birch (Guy Pearce) is a family man and esteemed professor of philosophy at a distinguished college. When Joyce Bonner, a high school student, goes missing, Evan's previous off-campus dalliances cause his wife, Ellen (Minnie Driver), to question his alibi. Meticulous police detective Robert Malloy (Pierce Brosnan) has even more reason to be suspicious when crucial evidence makes Evan the prime suspect in Joyce's disappearance. Suddenly, the questions Evan faces are not merely academic â€“ they are a matter of life or death.
