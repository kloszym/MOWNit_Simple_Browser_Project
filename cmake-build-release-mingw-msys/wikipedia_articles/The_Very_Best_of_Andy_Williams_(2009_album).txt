The Very Best of Andy Williams is a compilation album by American pop singer Andy Williams that was released in the UK on October 5, 2009. A note from Williams inside the CD booklet explains that the album "was put together to coincide with my memoir Moon River and Me, published by Orion Press. It includes many of the songs that you made hits. I truly appreciate that, and I hope you enjoy the songs we selected for this CD." This compilation includes recordings that either charted in the UK but not in the US ("Can't Take My Eyes off You", "It's So Easy", "May Each Day") or charted much higher on the UK singles chart than they did on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US ("Almost There", "Can't Help Falling in Love"). It entered the UK albums chart on October 17, 2009, and reached number 10 during its six weeks there.
On July 22, 2013, the British Phonographic Industry awarded the album with Gold certification for sales of 100,000 units.
An 18-track compilation album released in conjunction with the book publication in the US was titled Moon River: The Very Best of Andy Williams and had the same cover photo and design but had only nine of the 24 tracks on this album in common.
