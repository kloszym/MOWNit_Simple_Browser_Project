The thick-tailed pygmy jerboa (Salpingotus crassicauda) is a species of rodent in the family Dipodidae. It is found in China, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. Its natural habitats are temperate grassland and temperate desert. It is threatened by habitat loss. It is listed by the IUCN as being "least concern".


== Description ==
This species grows to a head-and-body length of around 45 to 60 mm (1.8 to 2.4 in) with a slightly longer tail. The head is large and the eyes small, the ears are short and tubular and the tail may have a thickening near the base where fat is deposited. These jerboas get most of their water intake from the food that they consume; however, they will drink water if they can find it.

Predators include owls, mountain weasels (Mustela altaica), marbled polecats (Vormela peregusna) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). This jerboa feeds on small invertebrates such as grasshoppers and...
