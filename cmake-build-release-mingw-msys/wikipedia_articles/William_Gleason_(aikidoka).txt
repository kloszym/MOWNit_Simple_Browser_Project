Gleason lived in Tokyo, Japan from 1969–80, where he trained in traditional aikido and Japanese sword at the world headquarters of aikido, the Aikikai Hombu Dojo. Gleason wrote a brief account of his training at the dojo, describing the training environment and people involved.
Morihei Ueshiba ("O-sensei"), the founder of aikido, had died the year before Gleason arrived in Japan. Gleason wrote in his account about his intensive training with the founder's immediate students and uchi-deshi, including Takeda Yoshinobu, Kisaburo Osawa, Watanabe, Koichi Tohei, Mitsugi Saotome, Masando Sasaki, Seishiro Endo and second dōshu Kisshomaru Ueshiba. He describes training most often and intensely with the late Seigo Yamaguchi, who became his mentor and friend.
Gleason received his 1st degree black belt in 1972 from Kisshomaru Ueshiba. In 1998, Gleason received his 6th degree black belt from Mitsugi Saotome.
