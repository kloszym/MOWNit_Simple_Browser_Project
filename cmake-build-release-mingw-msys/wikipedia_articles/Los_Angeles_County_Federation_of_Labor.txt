The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor (LACFL) is the central labor council for unions and worker organizations in Los Angeles County, California. The organization has its roots in the late 19th century when trade unions across the Los Angeles region formed labor councils for mutual aid, eventually affiliating with the American Federation of Labor in 1901. From the 1930s to the 1950s, unions affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) participated in their own Industrial Union Council while unions affiliated with the AFL continued to work through the city-based central labor councils.

As of 2024, the LACFL represents over 300 unions and more than 800,000 people throughout Los Angeles County.
