== History ==

In 1991 the band released Boomerang which included what has been called "the most controversial MATW song of all time," "Isn't Sex a Wonderful Thing?" The disc continued the trend of a heavier sound, with "If You Listen" rendering an atmosphere that can "make one envision a mysterious haunted mansion complete with a graveyard." The song "Sunday" drew comparisons to Alice In Chains and "Don't Give Up" "generates a sort of race car feel similar to songs by Stone Temple Pilots." Lyrically it focuses on sin, redemption, and God's love for people.
The liner notes of this disc contain the only photo in any of their discs or on their web site which shows the band smiling.
The CD sleeve contains the following text explaining the band's inspiration for the album title: "And remember, everything we do, right or wrong, kind or cruel, faithful or foolish, always comes back to you. - Galatians 6:7-8".
This album was reissued by KMG Records in 1999 on a "two-for-one" disc with Flowers in the Rain.
