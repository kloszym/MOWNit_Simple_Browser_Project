Win Bright (Japanese: ウインブライト, foaled 12 May 2014) is a Japanese Thoroughbred racehorse best known for his performances in Hong Kong. He showed good early form, winning once as a juvenile and taking the Spring Stakes and Fukushima Kinen in the following year. As a four-year-old he added a win over a strong field in the Nakayama Kinen but the rest of his form was unremarkable. He reached his peak as a five-year-old in 2019 when he won the Nakayama Kimpai and a second Nakayama Kinen before capturing the Queen Elizabeth II Cup at Sha Tin Racecourse. In December he returned to Hong Kong and recorded a second major victory as he won the Hong Kong Cup. He failed to win in 2020 but finished second in the Hong Kong Cup.

Win Bright is a grey horse bred in Japan by Cosmo View Farm. During his racing career he was trained by Yoshihiro Hatakeyama and raced in the black, white and red colours of Win Co Ltd. He had a white blaze and white socks on his hind legs but these markings became less visible as his coat lightened. Masami Matsuoka rode Win Bright in most of his races.
He was from the eleventh crop of foals sired by Stay Gold, a horse whose wins included the Dubai Sheema Classic...
