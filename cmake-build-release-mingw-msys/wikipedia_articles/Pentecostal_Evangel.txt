== History ==
Pentecostal Evangel was first published in 1913 as The Christian Evangel, one year before the formation of the Assemblies of God. Founders J. Roswell and Alice Flower created The Christian Evangel to report on revivals and missions activities.
From June 2002 to July 2009, the magazine was renamed Today's Pentecostal Evangel. It was also called The Weekly Evangel from 1915 to 1919, coinciding with the General Council locating its headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri. The name Christian Evangel returned when the headquarters moved to Springfield, Missouri, its current location.
In November 2014, the magazine announced that it would discontinue its printed publication at the end of the year, and switch to an online version at penews.org.
