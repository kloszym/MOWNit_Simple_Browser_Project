== History ==
Picture Me Broken was formed in 2005 by lead singer and keyboardist Layla Brooklyn Allman and bassist Austin Dunn. The band was originally called 'Lane Four' with 'Lane' reflecting the first initial of the original four band members (Layla, Austin, Nick, and Eric).  After several member changes and evolving style, the band settled into its new name, Picture Me Broken.  With early performances consisting of covers made famous by some of rock's best known icons, the band now writes, performs and records its own songs and has had several releases.
In December 2012, the band released a 4-song EP (Mannequins), produced by David Bendeth.
Picture Me Broken was the sole opening act for the Alice Cooper / Marilyn Manson Masters...
