== Main characters ==
Hazuki (葉月, Hazuki) / Luna (ルナ, Runa)
Voiced by: Chiwa Saito (Japanese); Monica Rial (English)

A 14-year-old selfish but adorable vampire, Hazuki was separated from her mother and restrained in a castle in Germany. She escapes the castle with Kouhei's help and flees to Japan in search of her mother. Much of the conflict between her and Kouhei stems from her giving him a vampire's "kiss", the act of drawing blood from a mortal, which normally turns the mortal into the feeding vampire's unwilling servant, but Hazuki's attempt on Kouhei fails. This is because Kouhei is a "Vampire Lover" and therefore is immune to the binding power of Hazuki's vampiric "kiss". Despite her continued claims that Kouhei is her slave and must obey her every command, Kouhei refuses to do so. Although she has trouble showing it, Hazuki truly comes to care for Kouhei and falls in love with him towards the end of the story.
Hazuki is also a host to an alternate personality...
