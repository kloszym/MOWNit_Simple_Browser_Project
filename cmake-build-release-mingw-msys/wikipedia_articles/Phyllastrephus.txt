Phyllastrephus is a songbird genus in the bulbul family Pycnonotidae. Most of the species in the genus are typical greenbuls, though two are brownbuls, and one is a leaflove.


== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The genus Phyllastrephus was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1832 with Le Jaboteur (Levaillant), now the terrestrial brownbul, as the type species. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek phullon  meaning "leaf" with streph≈ç meaning "to toss" or "to turn".


=== Species ===
The genus contains the following 20 species:


=== Former species ===
Several species from Madagascar that were formerly placed in the genus Phyllastrephus have now been moved into Bernieria and Xanthomixis. Commonly called the Bernieria and the tetrakas, these species are not bulbuls but Malagasy warblers similar to greenbuls due to convergent evolution. Formerly, some authorities also considered the following species (or subspecies) as species within the genus Phyllastrephus:

Honeyguide greenbul (as Phyllastrephus indicator)
Simple greenbul (as Pyrrhurus simplex)
Swamp palm bulbul (as Phyllastrephus leucopleurus)
