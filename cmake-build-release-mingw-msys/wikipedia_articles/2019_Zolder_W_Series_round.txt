The 2019 W Series Zolder round (also commercially referred to as #WRace2) was the second round of the 2019 W Series, and took place at Circuit Zolder in Belgium on 18 May 2019. The event was an undercard to the 2019 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters round at the same circuit.

Chadwick finished in second place, despite a late race charge by Alice Powell, who claimed the final podium place in third.
