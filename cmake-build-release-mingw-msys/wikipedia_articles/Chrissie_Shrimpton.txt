Chrissie Shrimpton (born 1944 or 1945) is an English former 1960s model and actress.


== Personal life ==
Shrimpton is model Jean Shrimpton's younger sister and was the girlfriend of the Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger from 1963 to 1966. According to the Stones biographer Stephen Davis, their 1966 album Aftermath was a source of embarrassment for Shrimpton, since "people generally identified her with the [album's] scathing put-downs", and that it led to an argument she and Jagger had while attending a party hosted by Guinness heir Tara Browne in April 1966.
