Thomas & Friends is a children's television series about the engines and other characters on the railways of the Island of Sodor, and is based on The Railway Series books written by the Reverend W. Awdry.
This article lists and details episodes from the 24th and last or final series of the show, which premiered on 2 May 2020 in the United Kingdom, and 1 September 2020 in the United States on Netflix. 
The series consists of 20 regular episodes as well as three half-hour specials: "A New Arrival", "World of Tomorrow", and "Thomas and the Royal Engine". The first two form a movie entitled "Marvelous Machinery‚Äù, while the latter is a celebratory episode commemorating the 75th anniversary of the original books.
As the "Big World! Big Adventures!" rebrand of the show was deemed a failure, Series 24 became the last series of the original Thomas & Friends series, with the next series retooled into Thomas & Friends: All Engines Go, a complete reboot of the series.
