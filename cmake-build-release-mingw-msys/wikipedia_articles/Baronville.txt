== History ==
Previous names: Barunvilla (896), Barandorf (1361), Barendorff (1383, 1461).
In 2007 a group of three University of York students attempted to get the fictitious town of 'BaronVille' onto the new UK version of the board game Monopoly. The news media thought that this was a French plot and reported, without sources, that the people of Baronville itself were behind it.
