The album was recorded at Krabi Road, Thailand with producer Lasse Lammert in January 2020. The album was mixed and mastered in the LSD Studios in Lübeck, Germany in February 2020. The music videos for the singles were filmed alongside the album in Thailand back in January. The band had seventeen shows in the summer that had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Speaking with Metal Injection about the lyrics in the album, lead vocalist Christopher Bowes stated: 

I think on this album it comes across pretty clearly in a lot of lyrics that we don’t care what people think. We know there’s loads of people out there who love what we’re doing. So if you hate it, we really do not care because we do what we want to do and it’s working for us.
