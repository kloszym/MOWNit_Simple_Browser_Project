Daniel D. Hutto is an American philosopher and professor of philosophical psychology jointly at the University of Wollongong and University of Hertfordshire.
He is known for his research on enactivism, affect, folk psychology and Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy. He is also known for designing and heading the Bachelor of Arts in Western Civilisation degree at the University of Wollongong. This degree has led to controversy due to being funded by the Ramsay Centre, of which former Australian Prime Ministers Tony Abbott and John Howard are board members, however John Howard has since stepped down from his position.
