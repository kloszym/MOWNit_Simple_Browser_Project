Prisonworld is the debut studio album by the German folk metal band Lyriel. It contains mostly balladesque songs.


== Concept ==
The song "Lind e-huil" is sung in Sindarin, one of the fictional Elvish languages created by J. R. R. Tolkien. "The Symmetry of Disfiguration" was inspired by Wendy and Richard Pini's Elfquest series.


== Reception ==

The Sonic Seducer and Rock Hard magazines interpreted the album as a tribute to Blackmore's Night. The latter review observed that while the album had been produced well the songs lacked a certain amount of pressure and did not really correspond to the Metal genre. Metal Hammer Germany compared singer Jessica Thierjung's voice to Doro Pesch and observed a frequent "Celtic mood" that was caused by the string instruments.
