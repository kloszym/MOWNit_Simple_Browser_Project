== Taxonomy ==

The vermilion tanager was formally described in 1858 by the English zoologist Philip Sclater from a specimen collected near the Napo River in Ecuador. He coined the binomial name Euchaetes coccineus. Sclater subsequently discovered that the genus name Euchaetes was already in use for a genus of moths and in 1879 proposed the replacement name Calochaetes. The new name combines the Ancient Greek kalos meaning beautiful with khaitÄ“ meaning "mane". The specific epithet coccineus is a Latin word meaning "scarlet-coloured". The genus contains a single species, the vermilion tanager. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.
