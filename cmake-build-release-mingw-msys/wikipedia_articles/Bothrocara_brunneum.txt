Bothrocara brunneum, the twoline eelpout, is a bathydemersal species of fish of the family Zoarcidae. The species is the only fish of the eelpouts to have two lateral lines and short blunt-ended gill rakers. The species has a wide range across the northeastern Pacific Ocean, between the Bering Sea and the shores of San Francisco, and from Attu Island to the Baja California Peninsula.
It inhabits the bottom of seas or oceans and is generally found in a depth ranging between 2,000 feet (610 m) and 6,000 feet (1,829 m). The species has also been studied to have shown a relationship between the season and its population increase and decrease, with the summer seasons being its highest and the winter seasons being the decrease in population size. It has been hypothesized from an analysis of stomach content that the species feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling creatures. Etymologically, Bothrocara stands for "cavity head" and brunneum for "brown", named respectively after the appearance of the head and the tinted brown colour of the body. It was named "twoline eelpout" for its unique two lateral lines.
