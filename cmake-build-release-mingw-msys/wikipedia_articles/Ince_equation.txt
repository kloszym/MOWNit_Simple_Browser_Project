In mathematics, the Ince equation, named for Edward Lindsay Ince,  is the differential equation

  
    
      
        
          w
          
            ′
            ′
          
        
        +
        ξ
        sin
        ⁡
        (
        2
        z
        )
        
          w
          
            ′
          
        
        +
        (
        η
        −
        p
        ξ
        cos
        ⁡
        (
        2
        z
        )
        )
        w
        =
        0.
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle w^{\prime \prime }+\xi \sin(2z)w^{\prime }+(\eta -p\xi \cos(2z))w=0.\,}
  

When p is a non-negative integer, it has polynomial solutions called Ince polynomials. In particular, when 
  
    
      
        p
        =
        1
        ,
        η
        ±
        ξ
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle p=1,\eta \pm \xi =1}
  
, then it has a closed-form solution
