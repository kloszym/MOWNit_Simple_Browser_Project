Passports are issued through the Passport, Immigration and Citizenship Agency (PICA), which was established in 2007 as an "Executive Agency" of the Government of Jamaica. PICA processes all Jamaican passport applications through its offices in Kingston including for all applications received by its High Commissions and consulates abroad.
