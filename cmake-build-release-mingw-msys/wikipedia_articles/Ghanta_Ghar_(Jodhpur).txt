Ghanta Ghar, also known as the clock tower of Rajasthan, is in the Indian city of Jodhpur.


== History ==
The tower was built by Maharaja Sardar Singh, from whom the adjacent Sardar Market takes its name.
An ancient clock tower stands tall, preserved in the middle of the city, believed to be the sole source for tracking time for locals in earlier times. The top of this tower gives an amazing panorama of the city.
