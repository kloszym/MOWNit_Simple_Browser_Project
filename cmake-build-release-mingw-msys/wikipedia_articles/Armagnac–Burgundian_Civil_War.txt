The Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War was a conflict between two cadet branches of the French royal family: the House of Orléans (Armagnac faction) and the House of Burgundy (Burgundian faction) from 1407 to 1435.

The Orléans branch of the family, also referred to as the House of Valois-Orléans, stemmed from Louis I, Duke of Orléans, younger son of King Charles V of France (r. 1364–1380). The House of Valois-Burgundy originated from Charles V's youngest brother, Philip the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy.
