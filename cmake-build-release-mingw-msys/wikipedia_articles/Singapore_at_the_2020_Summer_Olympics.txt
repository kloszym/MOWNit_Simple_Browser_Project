Singapore competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the Games were postponed to 23 July to 8 August 2021, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is the nation's seventeenth appearance at the Summer Olympics since its debut at the 1948 Games. In addition, Singapore was part of the Malaysian team at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, but did not attend at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, because of its support for the United States boycott.

Singapore failed to win any Olympic medals for the first time since the 2008 Summer Olympics, with the last time being at the 2004 edition.
