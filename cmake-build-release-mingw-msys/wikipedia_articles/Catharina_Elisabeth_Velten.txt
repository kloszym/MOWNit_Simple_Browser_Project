Catharina Elisabeth Velten née Paulsen (1646–1712) was a German stage actress and theatre manager.  She was the manager of the famous Hochdeutsche Hofcomödianten in 1692–1712.
She was the daughter of the actor-manager Carl Andreas Paulsen (1620–1679) and Catharina Lydia (d. 1675) and married in 1671 to the actor-manager Johannes Velten (1640–1692), who took over her father's theatre company in 1678. She acted in her father's and then her husband's company and took over it herself after the death of her spouse. Her company was famous in Germany and the Nordic countries.
She is described as an educated woman, and are known to have participated in a debate with the theatre-hostile deacon Johann Joseph Winckler of Magdeburg, when she refused his Biblical arguments in Latin and Greek.
