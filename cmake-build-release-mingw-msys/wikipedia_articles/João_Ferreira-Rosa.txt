João Manuel Soares Ferreira-Rosa (16 February 1937 – 24 September 2017) was a Portuguese Fado singer and lyricist. Although he considered himself an amateur, saying "I only sing when I feel like it", he is considered a "central figure in the universe of traditional Fado". The most emblematic song in his repertoire is Fado do Embuçado, a poem by Gabriel de Oliveira sung to the music of Fado Tradição, a traditional fado by Alcídia Rodrigues.


== Early life and education ==
João Ferreira-Rosa was born in Lisbon. As a young boy, during the summer holidays in Castelo de Vide, he became interested in Cante Alentejano, and started singing among friends and family. Shortly after, he became interested in Fado, admiring Amália Rodrigues and Alfredo Marceneiro in particular. He started singing in public after he enrolled in the Escola Agrícola de Santarém. This school was known for the violent hazing of the freshmen, but when the veteran students learnt he could sing Fado, they decided on not hazing him, as long as he sang for them whenever asked. It was also at this time that he started writing lyrics for himself and others.
