The Jacob Trieber Federal Building, United States Post Office, and United States Court House is a historic government building in Helena-West Helena, Arkansas.  It is a Modern International style three-story building, its exterior finished in brick with limestone and granite trim.  It was designed by Edward F. Brueggeman and Elmer A. Stuck & Associates, and built between 1959 and 1961.  It is one of the city's few International style buildings, and has been relatively little altered since its construction.
