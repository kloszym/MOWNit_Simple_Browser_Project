Streptococcus sobrinus is a Gram-positive, catalase-negative, non-motile, and anaerobic  member of the genus Streptococcus.


== Pathology ==
Streptococcus sobrinus in conjunction with the closely related species Streptococcus mutans are pathogenic within humans and enhances the formation of caries  within teeth. Biofilm from the mixture of sugar and plaque create a suitable environment for S. sobrinus to grow. S. sobrinus is more closely connected with the prevalence of caries than S. mutans. S. sobrinus is also affiliated with early childhood caries, which are responsible for the majority of dental abscesses and toothaches in children. Children generally acquire S. sobrinus strains from their mother, but the relatively high consumption of sugars by minors facilitates bacterial growth and threatens the onset of early childhood tooth decay. S. sobrinus has also been documented within the teeth of rats.


== History ==
Streptococcus sobrinus was discovered by the French biologist Louis Pasteur in 1887 along with other human pathogens. The full genome of S. sobrinus has been sequenced, and  the related species S. mutans has also been fully sequenced.
