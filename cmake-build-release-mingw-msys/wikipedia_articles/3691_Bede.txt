3691 Bede , provisional designation 1982 FT, is an Amor asteroid discovered on March 29, 1982, by Luis E. González at Cerro El Roble.
Based on lightcurve studies, Bede has a rotation period of 226.8 hours, but this figure is based on less than full coverage, so that the period may be wrong by 30 percent or so.
