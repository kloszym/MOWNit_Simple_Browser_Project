Brandon Cardell Hagy (born March 21, 1991) is an American professional golfer.
In college, he competed for the California Golden Bears.  While there, he won the 2014 Byron Nelson Award.
After turning pro in 2014, Hagy competed in Web.com Tour Q School but failed to advance to the final stage, and therefore had no status on any major tour in 2015. Through sponsor exemptions and Monday qualifying, he made six starts in 2015 on the Web.com Tour and eight on the PGA Tour, including the 2015 U.S. Open, for which he earned a spot through local and sectional qualifying.
Hagy finished tied for 79th at the final stage of Web.com Tour Q School in 2015, earning conditional status for the 2016 Web.com Tour. Thanks to five top-ten finishes in 16 events, he finished 19th on the regular-season money list, earning a PGA Tour card for the 2017 season.
Hagy was not considered a PGA Tour rookie for 2017 since he played in eight PGA Tour events in 2015 (more than seven allowed to retain rookie status). He recorded a top-5 finish at that season's RBC Canadian Open, which helped him to make the 2017 FedEx Cup Playoffs and finish the season 113th to retain his tour card for 2018.
