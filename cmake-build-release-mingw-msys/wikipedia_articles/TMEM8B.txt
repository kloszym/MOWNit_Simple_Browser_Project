=== Location ===
Cytogenic location: 9p13.3
Located on chromosome 9 in the human genome. It starts at base pair 35,814,451, and ends at 35,865,518, and contains 19 exons. There are 13 transcript variants that are protein encoding, and the longest transcript variant is 790 amino acids long.


=== Expression ===
Using information from NCBI's EST Abundance Profile page on TMEM8B, expression levels vary in 32 different human tissues. The highest levels of expression can be found in the brain, ovaries, prostate, placenta, and the pancreas. Expression levels are down regulated in some cancerous tissue, specifically nasopharyngeal and colorectal carcinomas. TMEM8B is expressed in all stages of development, including fetal stages, as low levels of expression are present in the fetal liver, brain, and thymus.
