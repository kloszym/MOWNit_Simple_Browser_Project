The Juvenelle Rosario Skua is a Brazilian mid-wing, T-tailed, single-seat motor glider that was designed and produced by Juvenelle Rosario of Florian√≥polis. When it was available it was supplied as a complete aircraft.


== Design and development ==
Named for the seabird of the same name, the aircraft is built predominantly from carbon fibre and intended to qualify as a European microlight.
The aircraft is a conventional self-launching sailplane, with a retractable engine. The 12.6 m (41.3 ft) span wing mounts dive brakes and holds water ballast. The wings can be folded for storage or ground transportation. The aircraft reportedly has a very low empty weight of 70 kg (154 lb).
In 2003 production was reported at one per month. At that time two customer aircraft had been completed and three were on order at a price of US$15,000 each.
