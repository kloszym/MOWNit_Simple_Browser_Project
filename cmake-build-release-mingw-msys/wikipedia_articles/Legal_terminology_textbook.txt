A legal terminology textbook is a textbook that arranges and defines legal words and phrases in groups and by topic, in contrast with a law dictionary, which arranges and defines legal words and phrases individually and in alphabetical order. Thus, it may be more suitable for a student or other person interested in understanding an array of related legal words and phrases.
