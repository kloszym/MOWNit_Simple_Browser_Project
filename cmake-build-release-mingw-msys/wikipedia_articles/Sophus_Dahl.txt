Oliver Sofus Pettersen Dahl (December 20, 1877 – November 30, 1952) was a Norwegian theater and film actor.
Dahl was born in Horg Municipality, Norway, the son of Peder Dahl and Johanna Iversdatter Elgaaen. He was the half-brother of the novelist and playwright Johan Bojer. Dahl married the actress Inga Sparre Dahl, with whom he established a touring ensemble after Ludovica Levy's National Tour (Nationalturneen) closed in 1912. In 1918 they started performing at the new theater in Stavanger, and Dahl was also involved in the start-up of the Trondheim Theater in 1911. Dahl led the new Søilen Theater from 1930 to 1932.
