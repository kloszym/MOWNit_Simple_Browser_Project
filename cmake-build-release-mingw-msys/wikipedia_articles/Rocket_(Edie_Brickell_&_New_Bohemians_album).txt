Rocket is an album by Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. The album was released on October 12, 2018, and is their first album since 2006's Stranger Things. The band wrote the songs on the album during the rehearsals of their 2017 La Rondalla Benefit Concert. After that they decided to record them, and the band recorded seven songs in eight days.
