The 1902 Philadelphia Phillies season was a season in American baseball. The team finished seventh in the National League with a record of 56â€“81, 46 games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates.

The Phillies held spring training in 1902 in Washington, North Carolina where the team practiced and played exhibition games at the city's race track inside the inclosure. The team journeyed from Philadelphia to Norfolk by boat on the steamer Yemassee, departing the Arch Street wharf on March 22, 1902. From Norfolk the team took the train to Washington. The Phillies made their headquarters at the Hotel Nicholson on Main Street. It was the only season the Phillies trained in Washington.


== Regular season ==
In 1902, the Phillies obtained an injunction, effective only in Pennsylvania, barring Nap Lajoie from playing baseball for any team other than the Phillies. The American League responded by transferring Lajoie's contract to the Cleveland Indians, then known as the Bronchos and subsequently renamed the "Naps" in Lajoie's honor for several seasons.
