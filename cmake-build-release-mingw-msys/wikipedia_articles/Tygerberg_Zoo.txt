Tygerberg Zoo was a 24-hectare (59-acre) zoo near Stellenbosch, South Africa, which was the only zoo in the Western Cape province and the closest to Cape Town. Established in 1979, it was privately run, operated for 33 years, and closed in 2012. It was "once a major tourist attraction and a hot spot for school educational outings" according to Cape Times coverage of its closure. Featured animals included chimpanzees and tigers, lions, and cheetahs. The zoo had 160 bird species and 63 reptile species, and "specialised in breeding rare and endangered animals."
The zoo was notable for its breeding successes, including the 1998 birth of "the world's tiniest tortoise", a baby Namaqua speckled.


== History ==
A predecessor zoo was founded by John Spence and Geoff McLachlan at Kraaifontein, just outside Cape Town in 1966. This zoo was soon moved, and at its peak had 61 mammal species and 160 bird species. It addressed a void created by decline and closure of the obsolete Groote Schuur Zoo, established in 1897 and known also as the Cape Town Zoo, that had been designed in a completely different era.
The Tygerberg Zoo was established on its 24-acre property in 1979 by John Spence. Lorraine Spence...
