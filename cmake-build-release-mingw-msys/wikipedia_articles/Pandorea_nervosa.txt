== Description ==
Pandorea nervosa is a woody vine with a stem diameter up to 30 mm (1.2 in). The leaves are pinnate with three or five leaflets about 45–100 mm (1.8–3.9 in) long and 10–50 mm (0.39–1.97 in) wide, the leaves on a petiole 15–35 mm (0.59–1.38 in) long, the end leaflet sessile or on a petiolule up to 8 mm (0.31 in) long. The flowers are borne near the ends of the stems in dense clusters on a peduncle about 20 mm (0.79 in) long, each flower on a pedicel 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) long. The five sepals are 6–7.5 mm (0.24–0.30 in) long and fused at the base forming a bell-shaped tube with lobes about 2.5 mm (0.098 in) long. The five petals are white and fused at the base forming a tube about 35 mm (1.4 in) long and 15–20 mm (0.59–0.79 in) in diameter with lobes about 8 mm (0.31 in) long. The fruit is a capsule about 125 mm (4.9 in) long containing winged seeds.
