Brazil's first female state governor was Roseana Sarney, elected in 1994 (and re-elected in 1998) as the chief executive of the state of Maranhão, representing the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB). Other women have held governorships since then, either elected in their own right or appointed on an interim basis.
