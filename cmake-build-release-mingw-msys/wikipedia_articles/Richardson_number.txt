The Richardson number (Ri) is named after Lewis Fry Richardson (1881–1953).  It is the dimensionless number that expresses the ratio of the buoyancy term to the flow shear term:

  
    
      
        
          R
          i
        
        =
        
          
            buoyancy term
            flow shear term
          
        
        =
        
          
            g
            ρ
          
        
        
          
            
              ∂
              ρ
              
                /
              
              ∂
              z
            
            
              (
              ∂
              u
              
                /
              
              ∂
              z
              
                )
                
                  2
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {Ri} ={\frac {\text{buoyancy term}}{\text{flow shear term}}}={\frac {g}{\rho }}{\frac {\partial \rho /\partial z}{(\partial u/\partial z)^{2}}}}
