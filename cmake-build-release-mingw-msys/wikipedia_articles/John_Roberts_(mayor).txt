Sir John Roberts  (October 1845 â€“ 13 September 1934) founder and managing partner of Murray Roberts & Co was a New Zealand businessman and runholder of the last quarter of the 19th century and the first quarter of the following century.
He brought his family woollen business to New Zealand initially by opening a Dunedin branch of Melbourne's (and Galashiels') Sanderson Murray following that in 1873 by floating a public company to buy Mosgiel Woollen Mill established two years earlier by Arthur J Burns. He was appointed first chairman of its owners at the age of 28  and remained chairman until he died.  Founder A J Burns, a grand-nephew of the great poet, was also a director.
By this time Sanderson had withdrawn from the partnership and his place had been taken by young William Murray who was two years younger than Roberts. At the end of the 19th century Murray Roberts was New Zealand's second largest wool exporter and Sanderson Murray & Co in London was ranked as the third largest importer of wool in the United Kingdom.
Roberts also found time to serve his community as Mayor of Dunedin and earlier as a member of the Otago Provincial Council.
