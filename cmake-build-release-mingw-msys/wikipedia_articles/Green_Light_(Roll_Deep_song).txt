Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a three star rating, and said:

Roll Deep are fast becoming the very definition of a guilty pleasure. The arts of subtlety and sophistication might be lost on them, but boy do they know how to hit our musical G-spots. Having reached No.1 back in April with 'Good Times', the capital-based collective are back with another slab of grime/trance/pop built to fill dancefloors across the UK.
Over a jolting bassline and clubby urban beats, Wiley and crew search for ladies up for a bit of bump 'n' grind action. "I like what I see / Face lit up like a Christmas tree" raps Breeze - all she needs now is a couple of baubles, eh mate? Anyway, 'Green Light' isn't quite as brain-invading as its predecessor, but be warned, this...
