Hawaii Five-O is an American police procedural drama series produced by CBS Productions and created by Leonard Freeman (not to be confused with the remake Hawaii Five-0, with a numeral 0 in the title). Set in Hawaii, the show aired for 12 seasons on CBS from September 20, 1968, to April 4, 1980, and continues in reruns. At the airing of its finale, it was the longest-running police drama in American television history, and the last scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1960s to leave the air.
The show starred Jack Lord as Detective Captain Stephen "Steve" McGarrett, the head of a fictional state police task force in Hawaii. The theme music composed by Morton Stevens became especially popular. Many episodes in the series would end with McGarrett's catchphrase, "Book 'em, Danno!"
