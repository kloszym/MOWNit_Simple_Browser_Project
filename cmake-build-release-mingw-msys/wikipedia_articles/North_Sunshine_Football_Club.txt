== History ==
Founded in 1967 as Crossroads Football Club, initially it operated solely as a junior club, fielding, in its inaugural year U/9's, U/11's and U/13's.
In the ensuing years a U/15 and U/17 side was fielded, and this remained the makeup of the club until 1979 which then saw the inclusion of a seniors side.
In 1994 North Sunshine added to its stocks by entering a Reserve grade side in the competition. The effect of fielding a full complement of junior and senior sides had an almost instantaneous effect on the club, with 1986 seeing the senior side take out their divisions Grand Final.
As the years rolled on, a third senior side was fielded in 1990, and a 'Superules' side in 1991. The new millennium saw North Sunshine Reserves win a Grand Final in 2000 and the senior side win their division Grand Final in 2003.
With a new coach in 2014 and many new players, the club got itself off the bottom of the ladder for the first time in 6 years.
