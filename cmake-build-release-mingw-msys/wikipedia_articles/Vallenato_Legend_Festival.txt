== Origins ==
Its origin dates back to 1968 when the celebrated vallenato composer Rafael Escalona, the then governor of the Cesar Department and former president of the republic of Colombia, Alfonso López Michelsen, and the writer, journalist and former Minister of Culture Consuelo Araújo, came up with the idea of organizing a festival that celebrated vallenato, a musical genre native to Colombia’s northern Atlantic coast and also celebrate a religious festivity of "The Virgin of the Rosario".
Since 1986, this festival has been organized by the Fundación Festival de la Leyenda Vallenata (Vallenato Legend Festival Foundation), a non-profit private entity in charge of the promotion, publicity, and defense of vallenato music as one of the intangible cultural legacies of Colombia.
