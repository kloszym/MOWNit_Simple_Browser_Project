Chilsu and Mansu (Korean: 칠수와 만수; RR: Chilsuwa Mansu) is a 1988 South Korean film, and noted director Park Kwang-su's debut film. Though not a box-office hit (only attracting 73,751 people in theatres), the film is remembered as a major step towards freedom of expression in South Korean cinema.
Chilsu and Mansu was the directorial debut of Park Kwang-su, who went on to become not only an accomplished director in his own right, but an influential role model for a new generation of socially conscious filmmakers. The film is one of the most memorable performances of two famous veteran actors, Ahn Sung-ki and Park Joong-hoon. The easy and convincing onscreen camaraderie shown by the two men foreshadowed their being cast together again in the hit comedy Two Cops (1993) and the action/art film Nowhere to Hide (1999). Bae Jong-ok, who plays Chil-su's girlfriend, continues to make her mark on contemporary cinema, taking on an acclaimed role in the award-winning Jealousy Is My Middle Name (2003).
