Emanuele Quercigh (born 1934 in Naples, Italy) is an Italian particle physicist who works since 1964 at CERN, most known for the discovery of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Quercigh moved as a child to Friuli with his mother and his younger brother after the early death of his father. Quercigh studied physics at the University of Milan in Italy, where he became assistant of professor Giuseppe Occhialini in 1959.
In 1964 Quercigh moved to Geneva, Switzerland, where he took up a position as fellow at CERN and subsequently became a staff physicist. Initially Quercigh took part in various experiments using the CERN 2 m Bubble Chamber. Then he proposed and led, together with David Lord, the ERASME project, a machine for scanning and measuring film from BEBC.
In 1974, Quercigh was appointed spokesperson of the T209 experiment, a bubble chamber experiment studying high statistics 8.25 GeV/c K–p, which discovered the φ(1850) particle–the first Regge recurrence of the φ meson–and performed a detailed study of the lifetime of the Ω–baryon, as well as a first evaluation of its spin.
As of 1979 Quercigh was the leading scientist for various CERN SPS experiments using the Omega Spectrometer, a facility...
