== History ==
E. C. Stearns & Company was a manufacturer of hardware and bicycles and entered the automobile business producing an electric car from 1899 to 1900.  The electric car sold in small quantities until fall 1900 when they decided to switch to steam cars and the Stearns Steam Carriage Company was formed.  George M. Barnes designed the steam car based on his Barnes Steam Trap of 1899.
The Stearns was powered by a compound twin-cylinder 8-hp engine, with a chain drive and tiller steering. It was offered in several body styles, including a station wagon which was probably the first use of that style of car.  The Runabout was priced at $900 (equivalent to $34,016 in 2024) while the top of the line Station Wagon was priced at $1,600, equivalent to $60,474 in 2024.  By November of 1901, the Stearns Steam Carriage Company reported to have produced over 100 cars.
