The Combat Tactical Vehicle (Technology Demonstrator) was a testbed vehicle built by the Nevada Automotive Test Center (NATC), for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle's Combat Tactical Vehicle (CTV), under contract for the Office of Naval Research (ONR). The United States Marine Corps tested and evaluated the vehicle at the NATC proving ground in Nevada for cross country mobility. Also included was ballistic testing of several armor solutions.
The vehicle demonstrated several new technologies, such as a fully adjustable front and rear suspension, with 21in wheel travel. The chassis and basic armor were made from aluminum by BAE Systems. The aluminum armor offered high level protection, concentrated throughout the lower hull. A B kit armor package, designed by Plasan, could be fit to protect the higher portions of the cabin.
