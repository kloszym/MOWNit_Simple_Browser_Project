The Alabama–Florida football rivalry is an American college football rivalry game between the Crimson Tide of the University of Alabama and the Gators of the University of Florida. Both schools were charter members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 1933. Although Alabama and Florida played 24 times between 1916 and 1991, the rivalry did not manifest until 1992, when they competed in the first SEC Championship Game, setting a precedent for years to come which would decide both SEC and national champions.
