== Early life ==
Tucker was born in Boca Raton, Florida. She is Ashkenazi Jewish, and the granddaughter of Lilly and Michael Schmidmayer, both Holocaust survivors from Hungary and Romania. Their stories were documented by the USC Shoah Foundation. Tucker has praised her grandmother, who has been living with Alzheimer's disease for years, stating, "My grandma is a Holocaust survivor. I think that's where I've got my hard work-ethic and the mentality to never give up from." Her grandfather died at the age of 97 in 2019.
As a child, Tucker enjoyed dancing and performing, so she went to one of Darrin Hensonâ€™s workshops in Orlando, FL. Henson recommended moving to New York City or Los Angeles. Eventually, Tucker's mother and manager Michelle opened up a hip-hop dance company called Pop Stars, where she received training by Dave Scott, Shane Sparks, Wade Robson, among others.
