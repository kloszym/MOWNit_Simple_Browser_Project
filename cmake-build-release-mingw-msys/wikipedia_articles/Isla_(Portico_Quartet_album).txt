=== Composition and style ===
Isla is Portico Quartet's second studio album and the follow-up to Knee-Deep in the North Sea, their Mercury Prize-nominated debut album.
The album saw a continuation and refinement of the live acoustic sound developed in Knee-Deep in the North Sea. While those songs were written busking, the songs for Isla were written over a period of four winter months in the band's garden shed. Reflecting this the album has a darker, more introspective tone than its predecessor.


=== Recording ===
Songs for the album were recorded in May 2009 at Abbey Road Studio 2. The album was produced by John Leckie. Electronic overdubs and string arrangements were added at Fish Factory Studios.


=== Artwork ===
Artwork and design for the album was done by the drummer Duncan Bellamy, who has a degree in Fine Art from Central Saint Martins. The cover is a painting by Bellamy.
