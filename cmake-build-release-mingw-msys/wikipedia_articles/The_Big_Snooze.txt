The Big Snooze is a 1946 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Bob Clampett and co-directed by Arthur Davis, who were both uncredited as directors. It features Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd, voiced by Mel Blanc and Arthur Q. Bryan.
Its title was inspired by the 1939 book The Big Sleep, and its 1946 film adaptation, also a Warner release.


== Plot ==
Bugs and Elmer are in the midst of their usual hunting-chasing scenario. After Bugs tricks Elmer into running through a hollow log and off a cliff three times, Elmer angrily quits because he feels that the writers never let him catch the rabbit. He tears up his Warner Bros. cartoon contract and walks off the set to devote his life to fishing, stunning Bugs, who piteously asks him to reconsider.
During a relaxing fishing trip, Elmer falls asleep. Bugs observes Elmer's nap, remarks that the dream he notices Elmer is having — that of a classic log and saw, representing snoring — is "a heavenly dream". Then, Bugs decides he had "better look into this", and downs a sleeping pill. He dreams he is inside Elmer's dream, in a boat crooning "Someone's Rocking My Dreamboat". He decides to use Nightmare Paint to disrupt the "serene scene".
