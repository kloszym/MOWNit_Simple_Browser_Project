Helicase SKI2W is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the SKIV2L gene. This enzyme is a human homologue of yeast SKI2, which may be involved in antiviral activity by blocking translation of poly(A) deficient mRNAs. The SKIV2L gene is located in the class III region of the major histocompatibility complex.
DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division.


== Identification of gene ==
A novel human cDNA, homologous to the yeast gene SKI2, was identified in 1995. Researchers localised the corresponding gene to chromosome 6p.21.
The SKIV2L gene, also known as SKI2W or Ski2-like RNA Helicase, spans 11Kb and contains 28 exons. Located between RD and RP1 gene in MHC III on the short arm of chromosome 6, it has 16 transcripts on Ensembl, 3 of which are protein coding...
