Udaan Trust is an Indian non-governmental organisation operating in the state of Maharashtra. It is the first HIV/AIDS organisation founded by homosexuals living with HIV/AIDS. Udaan focuses on issues of sexual health within the homosexual and transgender communities, particularly with regard to the prevention of HIV/AIDS. In order to accomplish this, Udaan provides services such as condom distribution, sex education, counseling, and medical services to at-risk populations.
Udaan also attempts to increase awareness of issues relevant to the rights of homosexual and transgender individuals and people living with HIV/AIDS. The organisation does not merely provide services to these individuals - it is meant to reflect their interests, as Udaan employs MSM, TG, and PLHA people (men who have sex with men, transgender, and people living with HIV/AIDS, respectively). Each of the six members of the board of directors is a person living with HIV.
Udaan is funded through personal donations, and attends to a network of an estimated 1500 people living with HIV. It has offices in Mumbai, Pune, Thane District, Raigad District, Jalgaon, Nashik, and Ahmednagar.
