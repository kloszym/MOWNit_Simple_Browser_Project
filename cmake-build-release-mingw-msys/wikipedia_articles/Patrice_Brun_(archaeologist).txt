Patrice Brun (7 July 1951, Koblenz) is a French archaeologist, a professor at Pantheon-Sorbonne University where he teaches European early history as well as theories and methods of archeology.
His main focus encompasses the 6,500-year BCE in Europe, from the advent of the Agro-pastoral economy to the State in a major part of the continent, with an emphasis on recent Protohistory, i.e., Bronze and Iron Ages. He greatly contributed to large-scale data collected from region-level excavation campaigns.
Patrice Brun’s research covers a broad range of aspects present in all Europe, namely trade and exchanges, the settlement patterns, and dynamics of identity. This multivariate and multidisciplinary approach allows shedding the light on Patrice Brun’s main focus: dynamics of social changes that led to the rise of State. His main contributions were on the "Urnfield Culture", the "Hallstatt Princely Phenomenon" in the Celtic territory in the North of the Alps, the origin of the Celts, the social meaning of funerary and non-funerary remains, along with the task specialization and the growing complexity of the european societies.
