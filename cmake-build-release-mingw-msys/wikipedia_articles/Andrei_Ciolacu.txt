Andrei Cosmin Ciolacu (born 9 August 1992) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Maltese Challenge League club Valletta.


== Career ==
In January 2016, Ciolacu signed a contract with ASA Târgu Mureș.
Midway through 2017, Ciolacu signed for Singaporean club Warriors, integrating quickly into the team.
On his Singapore League Cup debut against Home United, Ciolacu scored three goals, taking his club to the top of the group. In December 2017, he said that "The speed of play in Singapore is lower than in Romania, and the players do not give much importance to physical training, although this matters a lot in modern football. There is room for improvement, of course, but there is fantastic potential for development."
On 24 January 2020, Ciolacu joined Italian Serie D club Avezzano. He played for the club until the summer 2020, where he moved back to Romania to join FC U Craiova 1948.
