== History ==
The company was founded by Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) as ARCO Advanced Technologies in the late 1980s in Monaca, Pennsylvania. In 1992, the company was involved in the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Project (HAARP) after this project was approved by the U.S. Congress in 1992. A year later, the U.S. Air Force announced that APTI would become the prime contractor of the program. It was acquired by E-Systems in June 1994 and renamed Advanced Power Technologies.
In 1995 E-Systems was itself acquired by Raytheon. In January 1998 APTI was de-merged in a management buy-out to become a private company.
