Chikugo-Yoshii Station (筑後吉井駅, Chikugo-Yoshii-eki)  is a passenger railway station located in the city of Ukiha, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. It is operated by JR Kyushu.


== Lines ==
The station is served by the Kyūdai Main Line and is located 26.4 km from the starting point of the line at Kurume. Only local trains on the line stop at the station.


== Layout ==
The station consists of one island platform and side platforms serving three tracks at grade. Two sidings branch off track 1. The station is a modern structure but built in a traditional Japanese style with white plaster namako walls to recall the white plaster traditional houses which are a tourist attraction in former Yoshii town nearby. The station building houses a waiting room and a ticket window. Access to the opposite side platform is by means of a footbridge.
Management of the station has been outsourced to the JR Kyushu Tetsudou Eigyou Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of JR Kyushu specialising in station services. It staffs the ticket counter which is equipped with a POS machine but does not have a Midori no Madoguchi facility.
