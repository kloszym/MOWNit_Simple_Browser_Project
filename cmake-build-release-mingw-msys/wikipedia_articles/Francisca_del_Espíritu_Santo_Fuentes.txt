== Life ==
Francísca de Fuentes y del Castillo was born to Don Simón de Fuentes, a Spaniard and Doña Ana María del Castillo y Tamayo, a Spanish mestiza from Manila around 1647 (no record of her birth is found). Francisca grew up to be a fine lady, and she was given in marriage to a gentleman who died shortly thereafter leaving her a childless, young widow.
Francísca then dedicated her time to prayer and social service helping many poor and sick in the city. In 1682 she became a Dominican tertiary, taking the name "Francísca del Espíritu Santo".
In 1686, Francísca, Antonia de Jesús Esquerra, María Ana de Fuentes (Francisca's blood-sister), Maria Ana de la Vega, and Sebastiana Salcedo requested that they be allowed to live together in a life of prayer and the practice of the virtues while continuing their social apostolate. After a brief hesitation, their request was sent to the Master General of Order of Preachers in Rome, who approved it in January 1688...
