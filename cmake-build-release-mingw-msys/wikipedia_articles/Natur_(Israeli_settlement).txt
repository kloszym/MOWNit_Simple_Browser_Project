Natur (Hebrew: נָטוּר) is an Israeli settlement in the southern Golan Heights. The settlement was established as a kibbutz in 1980, after Israel occupied the area in the 1967 Six Day War. In 2022, it had a population of 958 settlers.
The international community considers Israeli settlements in the Golan Heights illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.


== History ==
Natur was established in 1980 by high school graduates from kibbutzim affiliated with the Hashomer Hatzair movement. In 2007 it converted from a kibbutz to a moshav. Membership at that time was nearly 200 people. Natur is a mixed religious-secular community.


== Archaeology ==
In 1984, several dolmens were excavated near the kibbutz chicken coops in Natur. Numerous stone heaps were documented in the area, along with terraces, walls and circular animal pens, some of which may date from ancient times.
