Balogna (French pronunciation: [balɔɲa], Italian: [baˈloɲɲa], Corsican: [baˈloɲa]) is a commune in the French department of Corse-du-Sud, on the island of Corsica.


== Geography ==
Somewhat isolated in a valley, the village is at an altitude of about 500 meters above sea level. It is the only Due Sorru that faces the sea, since the rest of the region lies beyond Col Saint Antoine and thus faces inland.
Two others valleys, now uninhabited, form with the first a territory that varies in elevation from just above sea level to almost 700 meters above it. The village, then, is situated in both mountainous and seaside areas.
Precariously perched, the village is in constant danger of rockslides from the nearby granite cliffs, although rockslides have yet to cause any serious damage.


== History ==
The village was established relatively recently, under the Genoan rule. One hypothesis holds that it was originally a place to exile people from Balagne (hence the name) who resisted Genoan rule, which would explain a lot.
No old artifacts exist in Balogna even though there are many in the surrounding area. On the other hand, there is a prehistoric site at Tragonatu.
