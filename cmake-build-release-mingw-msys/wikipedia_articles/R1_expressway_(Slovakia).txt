R1 is an expressway (Slovak: rýchlostná cesta) in Slovakia, which begins near Trnava (planned to begin near Bratislava) and ends in Ružomberok. The R1 passes Sereď, Nitra, Zlaté Moravce, Hronský Beňadik, Nová Baňa, Žarnovica, Žiar nad Hronom, Zvolen and Banská Bystrica. The former partial designation of this route was D65.

Both sections, Nitra - Hronský Beňadik and bypass of Banská Bystrica, were built, and are operated as a public-private partnership project.
