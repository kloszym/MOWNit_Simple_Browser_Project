Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) describes a system in which plug-in electric vehicles (PIEVs) sell demand response services to the electrical grid. Such services are either backfeeding electricity to the grid, or reducing the rate of charge from the grid at different times of the day. Demand services reduce demand peaks for grid supply, and hence reduce the probability of disruption from load variations.  Vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) are related concepts, but the AC phase is not synchronised with the grid, so the power is only available to "off-grid" loads.
Plug-in electric vehicles include battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). They share the ability to store electricity in their on-board battery modules, which are typically used to propel the vehicle's electric engine. V2G allows some of this energy storage to be sent to the grid, turning the vehicle into a small-scale grid battery that is eligible for claiming feed-in tariffs. A 2015 report found that vehicle owners could receive significant payments by charging their EVs at off-peak times when grid electricity is cheaper, storing it in their car battery, and selling it back to...
