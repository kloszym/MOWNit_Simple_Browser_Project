The NASCAR Pit Crew Challenge is a stock car racing competition held by NASCAR during the All-Star Race weekend. The event is an exhibition pit stop contest featuring the top teams from the NASCAR Cup Series.
The event was cancelled for 2013 due to lack of sponsorship. The event was revived in 2023.


== History ==
The event has its roots traced to the annual Unocal 76 World Pit Crew Competition. The competition was sponsored by ConocoPhillips, through its Union 76 gasoline brand (which at the time was the official fuel of NASCAR).
The competition was conducted during the weekend of the fall race at Rockingham, and was only open to a select few teams, usually the top teams on the circuit. Teams would qualify for the event based on pit stop performance during the season. The teams competed against each other based on elapsed time. Each crew had to complete a full pit stop (tire change, fuel), and had to complete it cleanly for their time to stand. Time penalties, usually five seconds, were added for any violations found by the officials (i.e. loose lugnuts on wheel). The team with the fastest time after penalties were assessed was declared the world championship pit crew for the year....
