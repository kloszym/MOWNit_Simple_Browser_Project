He was selected fifth overall in the 2004 NFL draft by the Redskins, where he played four seasons until his murder in 2007.
As a high school player, Taylor led Gulliver Prep to a Florida state championship and set the state record for single-season touchdowns. He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, where he was a member of their 2001 BCS National Championship team and won the Jack Tatum Trophy.

During the 2007 season, Taylor was shot by intruders at his Miami area home and died the next day on November 27. Posthumously, he earned a second Pro Bowl selection and second-team All-Pro honors. Taylor was inducted to Washington's Ring of Fame in 2008.
