== History ==
Minor league baseball play began in New Britain, Connecticut in 1884, when the "New Britain" team became members of the independent level Connecticut State League. The New Britain Perfectos were immediately preceded by the 1898 New Britain "Rangers," who played the season in the Class F level Connecticut State League. The Rangers folded during the season with a 14-38 record playing under manager Claude Gilbert.
After a nine-season hiatus, New Britain returned to minor league play in 1908, when the New Britain "Perfectos" rejoined the eightâ€“team Class B level Connecticut State League. The Bridgeport Orators, Hartford Senators, Holyoke Papermakers, Meriden, New Haven Blues, Springfield Ponies and Waterbury Authors teams joined the Perfectos in beginning minor league play on April 28, 1908.
