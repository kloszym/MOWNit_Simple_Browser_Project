=== Music ===
As a musician, he enjoyed popularity during the mid-1990s under the name Merlin. His 1993 self-produced first album A Noise Supreme was a blend of industrial rock and rap: "acid-dipped/metal/jazz/grunge fusion" according to Billboard.   The album received critical praise and generated a fanbase in Canada, partly due to MuchMusic airplay of the video for the single "Pusher."
In 1996, Merlin released the album Merlin's Arcade, "a most enjoyable slice of ear candy" according to AllMusic.  The single "The Playboy Interview" also received some airplay on MuchMusic. He also founded the pop-rock band Ma, whose album Cool Chicks and Other Babes drew comparisons to Weezer and released the industrial album Viddy Well Little Brother in 1997. In 2001 he released his major-label debut, Milkbar Stereo.
He later formed the group NAM:LIVE!, which he disbanded...
