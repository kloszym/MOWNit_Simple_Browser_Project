Claude Lawrence (born 1944) is an American jazz tenor saxophonist and self-taught abstract artist. Beginning in the 1960s he had a successful career as a jazz musician before switching his focus to painting full-time in 1986. His art is held in the permanent collections of over 40 museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Parrish Art Museum and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
Lawrence’s art has been described as expressing the rhythms and improvisation of jazz. His compositions, which frequently use bold colors and dynamic brushstrokes, are abstract while often approaching the figurative. Lawrence has stated, "I build a dialogue with each painting. It speaks to me, it tells me where it wants to go, and when it gets there, it’s born. It’s done."
