Jasper Ockeloen (born 10 May 1990) is a Dutch cyclist, who rides for Dutch amateur team Sockeloen Cycling Club.
He is the founder of Sockeloen, a company that designs and makes cycling socks, and of the Sockeloen Cycling Club as a means to promote mountain bike marathons and beach racing. Those two disciplines have races where professionals and amateurs can ride together and bond. He himself was introduced to beach racing by his girlfriend Riejanne Markus, a professional cyclist.
In 2021 Ockeloen followed the tyretracks of Laurens ten Dam and participated in Unbound Gravel. He had a flat tyre and a problematic reparation, early in the race. After a lot of overtaking he finished in 10th place. A year later Laurens ten Dam, Thomas Dekker, Ivar Slik and Ockeloen returned for a whole month of gravel races in the US.  Ockeloen won Gravel Locos solo and came third in Rule of Three. Later that year Ockeloen won a bronze medal in the Dutch national championships gravel race. These results moved Canyon to give him a professional contract for 2023.
