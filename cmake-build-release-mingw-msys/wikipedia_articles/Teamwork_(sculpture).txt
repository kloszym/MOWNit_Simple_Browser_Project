The sculpture honors William DeGrave, Jerome Starr and Jeffrey Wischer, three ironworkers who were killed by a piece of the stadium's retractable roof that fell when a heavy lift crawler crane failed during the construction of Miller Park. The widows of the workers, Marjorie DeGrave, Ramona Dulde-Starr and Patricia Wischer, settled a lawsuit against crane-maker Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of America, for an undisclosed total of over $99 million. Attorney Robert L. Habush represented two of the widows in their suit.
