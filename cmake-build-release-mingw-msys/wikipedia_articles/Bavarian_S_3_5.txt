The Class S 3/5 engines of the Royal Bavarian State Railways (Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn) were express train steam locomotives with a 4–6–0 wheel arrangement.


== Saturated steam variant ==
Between 1903 and 1907 Maffei delivered three batches of 39 locomotives in all. They had a four-cylinder, saturated steam compound engine. Unlike their forerunners, the Bavarian Class C V, the inside high-pressure cylinders and the outside low-pressure cylinders were angled and worked on the first coupled axle.
From the second series, built in 1904, the boiler pressure of the S 3/5 was raised from 14 to 16 bar (1,400 to 1,600 kPa; 200 to 230 psi). The tube lengths and diameter of the inside cylinders were also changed.
The S 3/5 engines built from 1904 were technically closely related to the S 2/5 which was being developed in parallel. The two classes only differed in their wheel arrangement and the larger coupled wheel diameter on the S 2/5; the boiler and running gear were the same and thus also their output power. Even the permitted top speed was identical on both classes  (110 km/h or 68 mph). The S 3/5 N engines were, in terms of tractive effort (300 tonnes or 295 long tons or 331 short tons...
