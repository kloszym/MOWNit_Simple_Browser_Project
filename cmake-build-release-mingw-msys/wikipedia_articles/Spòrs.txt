BBC Alba has the rights to various sporting events, which it covers in the medium of Scottish Gaelic and under the umbrella of its Spòrs sports television programme.
The programme is entirely in Scottish Gaelic apart from some interviews which are conducted in English. The programme is usually shown on Saturday evenings, although for live coverage of events this will tend to be at other times.
