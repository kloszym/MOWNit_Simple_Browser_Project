Blue Rose is a fantasy role-playing game published by Green Ronin Publishing in 2005. The game is in the romantic fantasy genre, inspired by fantasy fiction such as that of Mercedes Lackey and Diane Duane as opposed to Conan the Barbarianâ€“style swords and sorcery.

Blue Rose is notable for being the first role-playing game to explicitly accept characters of all genders and sexual orientations as well as romantic relationships between any two or more characters who are adults.
