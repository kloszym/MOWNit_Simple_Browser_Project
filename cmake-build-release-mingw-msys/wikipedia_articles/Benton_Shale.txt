The Benton Shale (also Benton Formation or Benton Group) is a geologic formation name historically used in Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska. In the "mile high" plains in the center of the continent, the named layers preserve marine fossils from the Late Cretaceous Period. The term Benton Limestone has also been used to refer to the chalky portions of the strata, especially the beds of the strata presently classified as Greenhorn Limestone, particularly the Fencepost limestone.


== Naming and status ==
The name was applied by Meek, F.B. and Hayden, F.V. in 1862 to the gray marine shales, often chalky in the middle layers, lying above the terrestrial Dakota Sandstone and usually below the massive limestones at the base of the Niobrara Chalk. The name was taken from the type outcrop at Fort Benton, today a small city in Montana on the Upper Missouri River.
Today, the Benton classification is obsolete in some regions, having been replaced by the ascending sequence Graneros Shale/Belle Fourche Shale, Greenhorn Limestone, and Carlile Shale. However, many old publications used the name. And the use of the Benton Group name continues in the Front Range...
