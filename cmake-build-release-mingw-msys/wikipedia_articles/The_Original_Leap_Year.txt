The Original Leap Year is the second album by Emm Gryner, released on Gryner's independent Dead Daisy Records.
Gryner funded the album with prize money from Standard Broadcasting's National Songwriting Competition. The album, which was credited as a thematic song cycle inspired by the zodiac, attracted significant media attention in Canada, and Gryner was offered a major label deal with Mercury Records. She rerecorded some of the same songs for her 1998 major label debut Public, although that album also included several newer songs.
