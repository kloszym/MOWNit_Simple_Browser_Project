== Life and career ==
Born in North Shields, Sargeant played keyboards in various local bands before joining regional R&B band the Junco Partners in 1966. He left in 1970 to become a studio musician in London, and in the early 1970s played live with Mick Abrahams, Al Stewart, and the band Curved Air, appearing on the band's album Airborne (1976).
In the summer of 1974, Sargeant began working on a solo album, First Starring Role, and met Mick Ronson who "was immediately impressed with Bob as both a songwriter and a performer". The soft rock album was recorded at Trident Studios, with Ronson co-producing it with Sargeant and Dennis Mackay. It features a number of well-known musicians such as Herbie Flowers, Walt Monaghan, Mike Garson and Cozy Powell. All the songs were written, arranged and sung by Sargeant, who also played electric guitars, keyboards and various percussion. It was released on 16 May 1975 on RCA Records and three singles were also released, but it found little success.
He became a regular producer of sessions on John Peel's radio shows on BBC Radio 1 in the late 1970s and 1980s...
