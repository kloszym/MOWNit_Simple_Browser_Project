How to Make Enemies and Irritate People is the seventh studio album by the Chicago-based punk rock band Screeching Weasel. Planned as the group's final album, it was released in September 1994 on CD, vinyl, and cassette through Lookout Records.

Screeching Weasel broke up the day recording finished and shut down their post office box soon after. During the break-up, vocalist Ben Weasel, Vapid and drummer Dan Panic went on to form the more Ramones-influenced band the Riverdales while guitarist John Jughead took time off from music to write and direct plays. The band would reunite in 1996 with Vapid back on bass for the Bark Like a Dog album on Fat Wreck Chords.
