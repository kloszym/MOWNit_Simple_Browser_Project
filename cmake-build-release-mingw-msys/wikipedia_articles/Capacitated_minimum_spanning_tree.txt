Capacitated minimum spanning tree is a minimal cost spanning tree of a graph that has a designated root node 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
  
 and satisfies the capacity constraint 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  
. The capacity constraint ensures that all subtrees (maximal subgraphs connected to the root by a single edge) incident on the root node 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
  
 have no more than 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  
 nodes. If the tree nodes have weights, then the capacity constraint may be interpreted as follows: the sum of weights in any subtree should be no greater than 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  
. The edges connecting the subgraphs to the root node are called gates. Finding the optimal solution is NP-hard.
