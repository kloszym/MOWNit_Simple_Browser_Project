The International Plumbing Code (IPC) is a plumbing code that sets minimum requirements for plumbing systems in their design and function, and which sets out rules for the acceptance of new plumbing-related technologies. It is published by the International Code Council based in Washington, D.C., through the governmental consensus process and updated on a three-year cycle to include the latest advances in technology and safest plumbing practices. The current version of this code is the 2024 edition. 

The IPC protects public health and safety in buildings for all water and wastewater related design, installation, and inspection by providing minimum safeguards for the general public, plumbers, residential and multi-family homes, commercial properties, schools, hospitals, and workplaces. Potable water distribution, water heaters, anti-scalding devices, back-flow prevention methods, water pipe sizing, sanitary drainage, venting, and many other plumbing related aspects are addressed in the IPC.
