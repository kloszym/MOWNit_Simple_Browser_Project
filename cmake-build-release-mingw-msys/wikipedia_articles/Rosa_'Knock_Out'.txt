Rosa 'Knock Out',  (aka RADrazz), is a shrub rose cultivar bred by American rose grower William Radler in 1989 and introduced into the United States by Star Roses and Plants in 2000. It was named an All-America Rose Selections winner in 2000.


== History ==
'Knock Out' was developed by amateur rose breeder William Radler in his Milwaukee, Wisconsin basement in 1989. The cultivar was developed from a cross between two unpatented, unnamed seedlings bred by Radler himself. The seed parent, with code RAD85-139.1, came from the open pollination of a seedling with parentage {Carefree Beauty x [(Tampico x Applejack) x Playboy]} x {Carefree Beauty x [(Tampico x Applejack) x Playboy]}. The pollen parent, code RAD84-196.8, had as parentage Razzle Dazzle x [Deep purple x (Faberg√© x Eddie's Crimson)]  Compared to the other new hybrid rose plants in his backyard test garden that year, Radler recalled that new cultivar was exceptional. "The rose was special, a dense bush full of pinkish-red blooms. No need to prune. Dead flowers just fell off. No need to spray. The rose appeared immune to diseases such as black spot mildew".

Radler was able to work with the wholesale nursery, Star Roses and Plants...
