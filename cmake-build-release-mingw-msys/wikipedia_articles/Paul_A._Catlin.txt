Paul Allen Catlin ((1948-06-25)June 25, 1948 – (1995-04-20)April 20, 1995) was a mathematician, professor of mathematics who worked in graph theory and number theory. He wrote a significant paper on the series of chromatic numbers and Brooks' theorem, titled  Hajós graph coloring conjecture: variations and counterexamples.

Originally from Bridgeport, Connecticut, Catlin majored in Mathematics with a B.A. degree from Carnegie Mellon University in 1970.
Catlin held a Doctorate in Mathematics degree from Ohio State University. From 1972 to 1973, he was a research and teaching assistant at Ohio State University, where he earned the Master of Science degree in Mathematics.
In 1976, he went to work at Wayne State University, where he concentrated the research on chromatic numbers and Brooks' theorem. As a result, Catlin published a significant paper in that series: Hajós graph coloring conjecture: variations and counterexamples., which showed that the conjecture raised by Hugo Hadwiger is further strengthened not only by
