"Tears Don't Lie" is a song by German DJ Mark 'Oh, a.k.a. Marko Albrecht, released in late 1994 by Urban Records as the third single from his debut album, Never Stop That Feeling (1995). The song was produced by Albrecht with Holger Scheiker. It uses the same melody best known in English-speaking countries as "When a Child is Born", which when originally a number-one hit in Germany for Michael Holm in 1974 was called "Tränen lügen nicht" or "Tears Don't Lie", which is a cover of the Italian Instrumental "Soleado" by Ciro Dammicco. "Tears Don't Lie" peaked at number-one in Austria, Germany, and Sweden and was a top-10 hit across continental Europe and Ireland. It was also nominated to the 1996 Echo Awards for the best German dance single. Matt Broadley directed the music video for the song.
In 2002, the song was released in a new version, as "Tears Don't Lie 2002", peaking at numbers 35 and 36 in Germany and Austria.
