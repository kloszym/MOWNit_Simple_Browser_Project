Don Valley Village is a neighbourhood in the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the former suburb of North York. Located north of Highway 401 and bisected by Don Mills Road, it is bounded by Sheppard Avenue to the south, Leslie Street to the west, Finch Avenue to the north and Highway 404 to the east. Like the nearby Don River Valley (to the east), the neighbourhood has hill and dale topography.


== History ==
The neighbourhood was originally a collection of farming hamlets in the early 19th century and takes its name from the Don Valley in Yorkshire, UK. Two historical landmarks still exist from that period: the Zion Schoolhouse and the Alexander Muirhead Victorian farmhouse.

The area was developed into a suburban neighbourhood in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1963, Consolidated Building Corporation developed a large part of Don Valley Village, advertising three-bedroom houses for $16,550, and providing a "trade-in" on purchasers' current houses. Major facilities built in the neighbourhood during this period, including the North York General Hospital in 1968.
