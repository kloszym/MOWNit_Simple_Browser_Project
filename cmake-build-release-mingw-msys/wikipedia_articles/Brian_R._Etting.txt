== Career ==
Etting told the Daily Bruin, “(The) most interesting filmmakers are the people that are really well-rounded, that have an education outside of the editing room, outside of the film classes and really study great writing and great authors and great stories. English, in retrospect, is the best thing I could have done. I developed great skills as a producer, was able to identify great material and then put all the elements together, which is the financing, and the director, and the talent, and understanding the foreign market well enough to mitigate risk and not lose your investments.”
