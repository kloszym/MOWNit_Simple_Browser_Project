Rajanpur  (Punjabi: راجن پُور),  is a city and the headquarters of Rajanpur District in the far southwestern part of Punjab, Pakistan. The district lies entirely west of the Indus River. 


== History ==
Rajanpur was founded by Sheikh Rajan Shah, the makhdum of Sitpur, in about 1732. He had captured his estates from the previously ruling Nahar tribesmen (see Tahir Khan Nahar). The settlement remained a largely unimportant village until flooding in 1862 severely damaged the nearby district headquarters at Mithankot  –  leading to the transfer of government offices to Rajanpur. A small dispensary clinic was established in Rajanpur that same year. Rajanpur was then constituted as a municipality in 1873.


== Demographics ==
According to 2023 census, Rajanpur had a population of 137,553.
