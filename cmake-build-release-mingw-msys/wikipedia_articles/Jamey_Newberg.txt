Jamison Dean "Jamey" Newberg (born March 3, 1969) is a Dallas, Texas lawyer and sports writer who became fairly well known since the late 1990s as an expert multi-media commentator on the Texas Rangers baseball organization, with an emphasis on the subtleties of minor league player development and complex trade strategies. Newberg originally compiled his analysis and observations (which have come to be known as The Newberg Report) into a semi-regular email memo sent to a handful of like-minded fan recipients. As his readership increased, those insights were also posted to a blog. Since 1999 his commentary has been collected and published in an annual bound volume each winter. Newberg has appeared regularly on Dallas television and radio broadcasts discussing the Rangers, has been a featured panelist on a regular Rangers-based podcast, and has also contributed written material to the Rangers official online presence on MLB.com. As of February 2018, Newberg joined subscription-based sports website The Athletic as a contributing writer covering the Texas Rangers.
