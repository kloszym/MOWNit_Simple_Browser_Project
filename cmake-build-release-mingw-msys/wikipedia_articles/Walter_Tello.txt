== Professional career ==
Tello made his professional debut in 2006. After a quick 6-1 start to his career, he fought veteran Edwin Diaz for his WBO Latino mini flyweight title, and won by technical knockout (TKO) on 23 February 2008 for his first belt. After four more wins, he received a shot at the interim WBO mini flyweight title, but lost (in lopsided fashion) to Mexican fighter Manuel Vargas in Hermosillo by unanimous decision (UD) on 14 February 2009. It was his first fight outside Panama.
One year later, he received another world title shot when he fought Giovani Segura, again in Mexico, for his WBA light flyweight title. The bout, held on February 20, 2010, was stopped in Segura's favor in the third round after he landed several punishing uppercuts and hooks on the young Panamanian.
Tello lost consecutive bouts to world title contender Carlos Melo in November 2010 and March 2011, both by decision. However, Tello followed this up by defeating fellow countrymen Carlos Ortega...
