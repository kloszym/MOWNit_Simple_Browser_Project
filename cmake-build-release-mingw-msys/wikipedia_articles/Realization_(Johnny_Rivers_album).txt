Realization is the fifth studio album by the American musician Johnny Rivers, released in 1968. Rivers wrote two of the songs and co-wrote a third.  The remaining seven are covers of popular songs from the mid-1960s.


== Reception ==
The album reached No. 5 and included the No. 14 pop chart single "Summer Rain", written by James Hendricks, a former member of the Mugwumps. The album reflected some of the psychedelic influences of the time, like the song "Hey Joe" with a two-minute introduction and also marked a change in Rivers' musical direction with more introspective songs such as "Look to Your Soul" and "Going Back to Big Sur".
