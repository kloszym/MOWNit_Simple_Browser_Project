Leverhulmia is an extinct genus of probable hexapod, known from a single partial specimen with preserved gut contents, found in the Windyfield (Rhynie) chert.


== Description ==
Leverhulmia is an arthropod roughly 1.2 cm (0.47 in) long, with at least five pairs of uniramous limbs, split into six podomeres, and an unknown number of segments. As the head is not preserved, it could not be firmly classified into or excluded from any group within Myriapoda, although a position within Diplopoda, or as a relative of Kampecaris, was hypothesised. Therefore, it was classed as Myriapoda incertae sedis. A later paper suggests it was a hexapod, specifically a relative of Zygentoma or Archaeognatha instead, after the discovery of thoracic leg segments which suggest the type specimen is part of the abdomen. Unlike Rhyniognatha and Strudiella, its interpretation as insect is not questioned yet, but it is not easy to interpret.


== Etymology ==
Leverhulmia is named after the Leverhulme Trust, for “the generosity of the Leverhulme Trust which supported this phase of exploration of the Rhynie and Windyfield cherts”. Its specific name, mariae is “in honour of Mary Duncan of Windyfield Farm, on whose land...
