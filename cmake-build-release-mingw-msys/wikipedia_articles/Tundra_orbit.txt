A Tundra orbit (Russian: орбита «Тундра») is a highly elliptical geosynchronous orbit with a high inclination (approximately 63.4°), an orbital period of one sidereal day, and a typical eccentricity between 0.2 and 0.3. A satellite placed in this orbit spends most of its time over a chosen area of the Earth, a phenomenon known as apogee dwell, which makes them particularly well suited for communications satellites serving high-latitude regions. 
The Tundra orbit, like the Molniya orbit, was developed by Soviet scientists. The Molniya orbit was specifically designed in the 1960s to provide better communication coverage for high-latitude regions, which geostationary satellites struggled to cover effectively. The Tundra orbit, while similar in its high inclination and elliptical shape, was developed later to offer continuous coverage over specific areas by having satellites spend most of their time over a chosen region. Both orbits were innovative solutions to the unique challenges posed by the Soviet Union's geographical location and the need for reliable communication and surveillance capabilities.
