Aklavik  (Inuvialuktun: Ak≈Çarvik) (from the Inuvialuktun meaning barrenground grizzly place) is a hamlet located in the Inuvik Region of the Northwest Territories, Canada. Until 1961, with a population over 1,500, the community served as the regional administrative centre for the territorial government.
Because of repeated flooding in this area, the government developed Inuvik 63 km (39 mi) to the east. It was meant to entirely replace Aklavik, but many of the residents of the original community persevered and kept Aklavik going. Its 2018 population was 623. The hamlet's mayor is Andrew Charlie.
