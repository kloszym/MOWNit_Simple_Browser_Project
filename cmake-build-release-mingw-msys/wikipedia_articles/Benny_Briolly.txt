Benny Briolly (born 29 October 1991) is a Brazilian politician and political activist. In 2020, she became the first transgender councilwoman of the city of Niterói, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, being the fifth most voted for candidate for the municipal chamber that year. She is a member of the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL).
After she was elected, Briolly began to suffer gendered political violence and was the target of threats, which led to her leaving the country. Upon her return, she was included in the Protection Program for the Defenders of Human Rights by the Brazilian government, being the first included in the program. In July 2022, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights  recommended that the Brazilian government adopt more forceful measures to protect the councilwoman's wellbeing, as she has been a constant victim of death threats.
During the 2024 Brazilian municipal elections, she was reelected, assuming her second mandate as a councilwoman in Niterói.
