Samarkand non or "Samarkand bread" is a traditional bread from Uzbekistan. It is a very popular bread that accompanies the numerous dishes of the traditional Uzbek cuisine.
It originates from the region of Samarkand. Shaped like a cake, it is thinner in the center, and has a rather soft crust. It is baked in a tandir, a traditional well-shaped oven.
In 2022, around 15,000 Samarkand breads were baked every day in Uzbekistan.

The baker told him that it might be because of the flour, which was not the same as the one from Samarkand. The emir sent for flour from Samarkand for his baker, but the bread still didn't taste the same. Perhaps the water, then? The emir brought water from Samarkand, but nothing helped, the bread still didn't have the same taste as what he had tasted before. The baker finally explained to him that what was missing in the bread was the air of Samarkand...
