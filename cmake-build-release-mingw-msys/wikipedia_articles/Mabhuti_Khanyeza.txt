Mabhuti Khanyeza, (born 17 June 1982 in Howick, KwaZulu) is a South African football manager and a retired South African professional footballer.


== Career ==
Khanyeza's arrival from Lamontville Golden Arrows in July 2007 after he had spent five seasons at the KwaZulu-Natal based team and scored 43 goals in the 102 official league and cup matches that he had participated in between 2002 and 2007, was according to many commentators bound to happen sooner or later.
And for some it was inevitable that the soft-spoken man from the rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal would eventually don the gold and black strip of The Amakhosi. Khenyeza was a major hit on his official debut for Chiefs on the opening night of the 2007â€“2008 season, after coming close to scoring as he was unfortunate to have hit the cross bar twice in the game.
He managed to find the back of the net against Benoni Premier United from the penalty spot in the final minute of the game, which gave him a goal on debut. Often thought of as one of the players who has perhaps not represented his country as regularly as he should have, Khanyeza's move to Chiefs is a step in the right direction as apart from the possibility of adding silverware...
