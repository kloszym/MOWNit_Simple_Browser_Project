Elmet (Welsh: Elfed), sometimes Elmed or Elmete, was an independent Brittonic Celtic 
Cumbric-speaking kingdom between about the 4th century and mid-7th century.
The people of Elmet survived as a distinctly recognised Brittonic Celtic group for centuries afterwards in what later became the smaller area of the West Riding of Yorkshire, and now West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and north Derbyshire.


== Geography ==
The precise borders of the original kingdom of Elmet are unclear. It may have been bounded by the rivers Sheaf in the south and Wharfe in the east until the 7th century. To the north it adjoined the kingdom of Deira and Mercia to the south, while its western boundary appears to have been near Craven, which was possibly another minor British kingdom. As such, it was not conterminous with other territories of the Britons at the time, being well to the south of others in the Hen Ogledd ("Old North"), such as Strathclyde, and north-east of Wales, Cornwall and Dumnonia. As one of the south-easternmost Brittonic regions for which there is reasonably substantial evidence, Elmet is notable for having survived relatively late in the period of Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.
