Ameer Ali is the former president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, an umbrella group for various Islamic groups or councils in Australia. In 2006, he was the chairman of the Australian Muslim Community Reference Group, which was an advisory body to the federal government from mid-2005 to mid-2006.
Ali was educated at the University of Ceylon in Sri Lanka, the London School of Economics, and received a doctorate in economics from the University of Western Australia in 1980. He has taught economics at the University of Ceylon, Murdoch University, the University of Brunei and the University of Western Australia.
In 2005, Ali said that governments should, "rid the community of radical elements" and also prevent radical speakers coming to Australia.  And further, the Muslim community needs to consider what is being taught to its young people.
In 2015, Ali called on religious leaders to oppose the Islamic State as, "I haven't heard so far any single imam in this country that has named IS and condemned it."
