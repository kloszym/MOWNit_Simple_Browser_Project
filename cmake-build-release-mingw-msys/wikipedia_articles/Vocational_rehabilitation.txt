Vocational rehabilitation, also abbreviated VR or voc rehab, is a process which enables persons with functional, psychological, developmental, cognitive, and emotional disabilities, impairments or health disabilities to overcome barriers to  accessing, maintaining, or returning to employment or other useful occupations.

Whilst, traditionally, the focus of vocational rehabilitation was job retention, an increased focus on an all-encompassing approach has become popular in contemporary approaches. Approaches differ between countries, however, due to the differing amounts of financial and political support vocational rehabilitation receives.
