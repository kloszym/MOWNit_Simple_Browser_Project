"Lena Anthem" is a song by Swedish singer Lena Philipsson from her ninth studio album Det gör ont en stund på natten men inget på dan (2004). It was released as the album's third single on 11 October 2004 through Columbia and Sony Music. Written by Thomas "Orup" Eriksson and produced by Anders Hansson, "Lena Anthem" is a disco song with synthesizer instrumentation and interpolations of Philipsson's 1987 single "Dansa i neon". Lyrically, the song contains exaggerated and tongue-in-cheek statements that proclaim her greater than her rivals.
The song was met with generally positive reviews in the Swedish press; several music critics praised its overconfident and humorous lyrics. "Lena Anthem" was Philipsson's fourth consecutive top-five entry of 2004 on the Sverigetopplistan singles chart, peaking at number four. The song also attained top-ten positions on the Svensktoppen and Trackslistan charts. The song was ranked at number 34 on the 2004 year-end chart of Sverigetopplistan. In 2011, Philipsson performed a live rendition of "Lena Anthem" with E-Type on Så mycket bättre.
