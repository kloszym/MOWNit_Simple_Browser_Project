Parliamentary elections were held in Bulgaria between 6 and 27 March 1938, the first after the 1934 coup. The elections were held on a non-partisan basis, with the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union and Bulgarian Communist Party banned. Pro-government candidates won a majority of seats. Voter turnout was 69.5%.
Women were allowed to vote – for the first time – if they were married, divorced or widowed.
