Popular Unity (Spanish: Unidad Popular) is a Uruguayan electoral alliance of Left-wing and Socialist political parties.
Previously known as Popular Assembly, they were born out of dissatisfaction with the Broad Front since it became the party in charge of the government, accusing it of being "not leftist enough". In 2013 they changed to the current name. They took part in the 2014 Uruguayan general election, when they got their first representative at the Chamber of Deputies, who has been a vocal critic of the centre-left government.
Their candidate to the 2019 Uruguayan general election was once again Gonzalo Abella, with an anti-oligarchy and anti-imperialist platform.
In 2023 they reached an agreement with the Workers' Party and the Struggling Workers' Front, forming an electoral agreement called the Popular Unity - Workers' Front. The candidate for that front in 2024 was Gonzalo Mart√≠nez from the Popular Unity, with Andrea Revuelta from the Workers' Party as the running mate.
