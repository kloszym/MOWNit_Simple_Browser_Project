Peptidyl-glutamate 4-carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.90, vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, gamma-glutamyl carboxylase) is an enzyme with systematic name peptidyl-glutamate 4-carboxylase (2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone-epoxidizing). This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

peptidyl-4-carboxyglutamate + 2,3-epoxyphylloquinone + H2O 
  
    
      
        â‡Œ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }
  
 peptidyl-glutamate + CO2 + O2 + phylloquinone
The enzyme can use various vitamin-K derivatives, including menaquinone.
