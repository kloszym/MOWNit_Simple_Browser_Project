Eva de Braose ( fl. 1238â€“July 1255) was one of the four co-heiresses of William de Braose. She was the wife of William de Cantilupe who, as a result of his marriage, acquired significant land holdings in both England and Wales.

Eva de Braose was one of the four daughters of William de Braose and Eva Marshal. Her sisters were Isabella, Maud, and Eleanor. William was the last of the Braose Marcher lords who possessed extensive lands in Wales, Herefordshire, Sussex and Devon. Eva Marshall was a daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. William de Braose was hanged by Llywelyn the Great, Prince of Gwynedd in 1230 and the four young sisters became co-heiresses of valuable property. All the sons of their maternal grandfather William Marshal died without heirs and in 1247 the Braose sisters each inherited a share of their mother's portion of the Marshal estates.
