== High school/college ==
Birkins attended El Camino Real high school in Woodland Hills, California. He played baseball for the Conquistadors and helped them win back-to-back LA City Championships in 1997 and 1998. He was named MVP of the 1998 championship game after throwing a 10 inning complete game, striking out 12, and hitting the go ahead 2-run double.
Birkins pitched for the UCLA Bruins in 1999 and led the staff in ERA, but decided to step away after the season due to burn out. During his time away from school, he volunteered as an assistant coach for his alma mater. That June, Birkins was selected in the 33rd round (984th overall) by the Baltimore Orioles. El Camino Real's senior infielder Conor Jackson was drafted in the 31st round (936th overall) by the Cleveland Indians which meant a player and coach from the same high school were drafted on the same day, and both went on to play in the Major Leagues.
In the fall of 2000, Birkins enrolled at Los Angeles Pierce College and was rated by Baseball America...
