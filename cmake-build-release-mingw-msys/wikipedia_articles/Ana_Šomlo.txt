== Early life and education ==
Ana Šomlo was born on 27 March 1935 in Negotin, Serbia, to Miroslav Šomlo and Budimka Šomlo (née Smederevac). She spent her early childhood in Negotin. Her father was interned twice, in 1941 and 1942, in a camp near Zaječar. Ana lived until 1943, together with her sister, with relatives from Vršac, after which she returned to Negotin. Due to the anti-Semitic measures of the German authorities, she fled with her father and sister to Malajnica, and then to the Homolje mountains, where they hid until the end of the Second World War. After the war, her family left Negotin and moved to Vršac. From 1946 to 1948, she lived in Pančevo, where her father worked on the design and construction of the bridge that connects Belgrade with the city. After the bridge was completed, the family moved to Novi Sad.
