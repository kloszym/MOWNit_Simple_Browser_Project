"Just Say Yes" is the first episode of the  American fantasy comedy series Ted. Written and directed by series creator Seth MacFarlane, it premiered on the American streaming service Peacock, along with the rest of season one, on January 11, 2024. The episode introduces John Bennett (Max Burkholder), the series' primary protagonist, an awkward high-school aged boy, along with Ted (Seth MacFarlane), the series' titular anthropomorphic teddy bear. The two live with John's family, Susan (Alanna Ubach), his mild mannered mother, and Matty (Scott Grimes), his conservative father. Also residing with the family is Blaire (Giorgia Whigham), his radically liberal cousin whom often clashes with Matty.
The series acts as a precursor to the Ted film franchise, showcasing the childhood lives of John and Ted. Like the rest of the season, "Just Say Yes" makes use of Viewscreen, a technology that allows the production crew to visualize what Ted's presence in each scene will look like in real time. While auditioning for the part of Matty, Grimes was told to "think of All in the Family". The episode received mixed reviews from critics, who condemned the episode's crass humor and offensive nature.
