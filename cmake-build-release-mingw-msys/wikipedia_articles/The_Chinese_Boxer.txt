The Chinese Boxer (龙虎斗; also known by its international title The Hammer of God) is a 1970 Hong Kong action kung fu film written, directed by and starring Jimmy Wang Yu. Tong Gaai was the action director. The Chinese Boxer was a box office success at the time of its release and resulted in a switch of emphasis within the wuxia genre away from swordsmanship and towards unarmed combat. It would prove influential to subsequent films like Fist of Fury.
The film was followed by a 1977 sequel called Return of the Chinese Boxer.
