On 6 December 1997 a Russian Air Force Antonov An-124-100, en route from Irkutsk Northwest Airport to Cam Ranh Air Base in Vietnam, crashed in a residential area after takeoff from the airport.
Leased by Ukrainian Cargo Airways, the aircraft was carrying two Sukhoi Su-27UBK fighters (8524 and 8525) for delivery to the Vietnam People's Air Force, with a planned stopover at Vladivostok.
Three seconds after lift-off from Runway 14 at Irkutsk, the No.3 engine surged at approximately 5 metres (16 ft) altitude. The aircraft continued to climb, but at a high angle of attack, disrupting airflow to No.1 and No.2 engines which also surged.
Unable to continue climbing the aircraft descended until it struck houses in Mira Street, 1,600 metres (5,200 ft; 1,700 yd) beyond the runway end, killing all 23 on board and 49 persons on the ground.
