Sambrook's Brewery is a British brewery, based in Wandsworth, London. The location is the oldest continually brewing site in the UK. 
Sambrooks started brewing in Battersea 2008. It was founded by Duncan Sambrook, who had been an accountant for Deloitte, with support from David Welsh, the former owner of the Ringwood Brewery. In July 2019, it was announced that Sambrook's  would be moving to the former Young's brewery site in Wandsworth, and will have a tap room, visitors' centre and brewery museum. The move was delayed due to COVID-19 but finally completed in December 2020 and the taproom and visitor centre opened in July 2021. 
Most of the beers brewed by Sambrook's are named after local landmarks in South West London, most notably their flagship product "Wandle" named for the river.
