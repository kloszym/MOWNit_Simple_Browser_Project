In linear algebra, linear transformations can be represented by matrices. If 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
  
 is a linear transformation mapping 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
  
 to 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
          x
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }
  
 is a column vector with 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
 entries, then there exists an 
  
    
      
        m
        Ã—
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\times n}
  
 matrix 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  
, called the transformation matrix of 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
  
, such that:

  
    
      
        T
        (
        
          x
        
        )
        =
        A
        
          x
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T(\mathbf {x} )=A\mathbf {x} }
