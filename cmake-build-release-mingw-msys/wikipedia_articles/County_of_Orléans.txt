The County of Orléans was an area of early medieval France including the city of Orléans and its countryside. It was governed by a count.
When Hugh Capet became King of France, the county of Orléans became a part of the royal domain. The lands formed part of the appanages granted to various younger sons of Kings of France with the title Duke of Orléans.
