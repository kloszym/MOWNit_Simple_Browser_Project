Remember You is the eighteenth studio album by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki. Preceded by seven singles released from 2020 to 2022, it also marks her first studio album release in the Reiwa era.
To promote the release, Hamasaki named her New Year's Eve concerts after the album: Countdown Live 2022â€“2023 A: Remember You. Two concerts were held over December 30 and 31, with the latter date streamed through dTV. On December 28, it was announced that the song "(Not) Remember You" would be made available on January 1, 2023, as a pre-release album track on all streaming platforms. A second pre-release album track, "Just the Way You Are", was released on January 18 alongside a promotional clip featuring Kumamoto Pro-Wrestling, a member of the comedy duo Benishoga. After its release online, Japanese media widely covered the collaboration, praising the song as "a gentle, yet emotional ballad".

Hamasaki confirmed that she was working on her next studio album in April 2022, announcing it at the end of her Asia Tour: 24th Anniversary Special concert. Its release date was later changed due to issues with writer's block, moving from 2022 to January 25, 2023.
