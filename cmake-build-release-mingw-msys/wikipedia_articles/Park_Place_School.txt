The Park Place School in the Point Breeze neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was built in 1903 at the then-extravagant cost of $100,000, with 9 classrooms and a basement play area.
The school closed in 1979 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Later, it briefly functioned as an apartment building.  Since 2012 it has hosted part of the Environmental Charter School.
