Argyrochosma palmeri is a fern endemic to Mexico. It has narrow, divided leaves with black axes; the leaves are coated in white powder below, and sparsely dusted or free of it above. First described as a species in 1887, it was transferred to the new genus Argyrochosma (the "false cloak ferns") in 1987, recognizing their distinctness from the "cloak ferns" (Notholaena sensu stricto).


== Description ==
Argyrochosma palmeri is a medium-sized epipetric fern. The rhizome is short, compact, and horizontal. It bears linear to lanceolate scales 3 millimeters (0.1 in) long, of a uniform light brown color (or somewhat darker at the base), with entire (toothless) margins.
The fronds arise in clumps from the rhizome. From base to tip of leaf, they are 10 to 15 centimeters (3.9 to 5.9 in) long, rarely as short as 3 centimeters (1 in). Of this length, from 10% to 17% is made up by the stipe (the stalk of the leaf, below the blade). Both stipe and rachis (leaf axis) are round and black, lacking hairs, scales or glands and occasionally bearing a very sparse coating of white farina (powder).
The leaf blades are narrowly oblong or linear. They are bipinnate-pinnatifid to tripinnate (cut into pinnae...
