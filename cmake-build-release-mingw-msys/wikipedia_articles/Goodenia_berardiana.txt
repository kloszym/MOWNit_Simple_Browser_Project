The leaves are 20–160 mm (0.79–6.30 in) long and 2–12 mm (0.079–0.472 in) wide, linear to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, sometimes lobed or toothed. The flowers are arranged in racemes or few-flowered umbels with leaf-like bracts at the base, each flower on a pedicel 2–7 mm (0.079–0.276 in) long. The sepals are narrow elliptic, 1.5–2.5 mm (0.059–0.098 in) long and the petals are yellow, 6–15 mm (0.24–0.59 in) long and hairy inside. The lower lobes of the corolla are 2.5–7 mm (0.098–0.276 in) long with wings about 1–2.5 mm (0.039–0.098 in) wide. Flowering mainly occurs from May to October and the fruit is an elliptical capsule 8–12 mm (0.31–0.47 in) long.
