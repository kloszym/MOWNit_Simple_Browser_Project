Walser Privatbank is an Austrian bank with headquarters in Hirschegg (Mittelberg), Austria. It was originally founded in 1894 as the regional Spar- und Darlehenskassenverein Mittelberg. Its business focus has shifted to private banking, especially for customers with assets of at least 300,000 Euros from Germany.
Due to its location in the Kleinwalsertal customs exclusion area, Walser Privatbank lies in German economic territory, but not under the jurisdiction of German customs. "The Kleinwalsertal benefited from Austrian banking secrecy for many years as a banking location."
The company as a stock corporation specializes in customers with liquid fixed assets of more than 300,000 Euros. As of 2017, the banks assets under management (AUM) were just under 2.9 billion Euros. In addition to its headquarters in Kleinwalsertal (Austria), the bank has branches in Düsseldorf and Stuttgart. It has around 140 employees.
