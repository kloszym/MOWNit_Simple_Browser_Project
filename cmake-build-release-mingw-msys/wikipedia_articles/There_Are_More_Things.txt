"There Are More Things" is a short story written by Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges in 1975. It was first published in the short story collection The Book of Sand, as the collection's fourth entry. The story tells of the encounter the narrator has with a monstrous entity inhabiting an equally monstrous house. It bears the dedication "In Memory of H. P. Lovecraft" and accordingly holds many parallels with Lovecraft's stories, employing similar plot devices. The title alludes to Hamlet's lines "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy" (Hamlet I.5:159–167).
The story has been criticized because the episode of the encounter with the monster and the house—the heart of the story—which is described in the final two or so pages, is preceded by "eight pages of complicated subplots," spoiling "a basically sound idea." Borges himself was quite skeptical about his memorial to Lovecraft (as expressed in the book's epilogue), whom he in fact considered "an involuntary parodist of Poe."
