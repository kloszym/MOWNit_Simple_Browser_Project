David Johnston (24 March 1903 â€“ 5 July 1938) was a New Zealand international rugby union player.
Johnston was an inside back known for his tactical nous and represented Taranaki regularly from 1922 to 1932. He unsuccessfully trialled for the All Blacks several times until gaining a call up in 1925, as a replacement for Joseph Bell on a tour of Australia, where he would make two uncapped appearances.
After a period of ill health, Johnston died at a New Plymouth hospital in 1938, aged 35.
