Sydney Grundy (23 March 1848 â€“ 4 July 1914) was an English dramatist.  Most of his works were adaptations of European plays, and many became successful enough to tour throughout the English-speaking world.  He is, however, perhaps best remembered today as the librettist of several comic operas, notably Haddon Hall.


== Life and career ==
Grundy was born in Manchester, England, the son of Alderman Charles Sydney Grundy. He was educated at Owens College, Manchester, and studied law at the Middle Temple.  He was called to the bar in 1869 and practised law until 1876.


=== Early career ===
His early one-act farce, A Little Change, was produced at the Haymarket Theatre in 1872 by the Kendals.  This was followed by All at Sea in 1873, also starring the Kendals. In 1876, Grundy published The Days of His Vanity. He wrote Mammon for W. H. Vernon at the Strand Theatre in 1877 and After Long Years for the Folly Theatre in 1879. Early comedies included The Glass of Fashion (1882), The Silver Shield (1885), and the blank verse Clito for Wilson Barrett (1886).

Grundy became well known as an adapter of French and German plays, cleaning them up for British audiences and revisiting the source material...
