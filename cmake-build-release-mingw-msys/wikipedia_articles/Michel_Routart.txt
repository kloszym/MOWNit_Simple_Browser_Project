== Life ==
Born around 1580 at Arras, then part of the Habsburg Netherlands, Routart studied at Leuven University, graduating Licentiate of Law. He entered the service of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella as a clerk in the secretariat of state. In 1623 he was sent on a mission to the royal court in Spain, where Philip IV of Spain awarded him the title of royal secretary in Castile, apparently as a purely honorary function. Routart soon left Spain and worked as secretary to Ambrogio Spinola, commander of the royal armies in the Low Countries and the Lower Palatinate. In that capacity he was involved in the negotiations for the capitulation of Breda in 1625. In June 1625, Archduchess Isabella appointed him ordinary secretary to the Privy Council, but he accompanied Spinola on his journeys to Spain and Italy. In January 1630 he was briefly appointed secretary for Italian letters in the government of the Duchy of Milan, and on 22 May 1630 Isabella appointed him governor of Oppenheim in the Palatinate.
