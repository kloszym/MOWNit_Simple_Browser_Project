Kate Sicchio is a choreographer and digital artist, notable for her work bringing together choreography, dance technology, e-textiles, and live coding performance. She is also active as curator and event organiser in the digital arts.  
Sicchio's choreographic work often develops and applies live coding techniques to create instructions followed by human dancers, whether through text-based instructions, diagrams, or e-textile actuators designed into the dancers' costumes. She also live codes music, and organises events within the Algorave community.  
In her academic life, Sicchio worked as assistant professor of integrated digital media at New York University until 2018, when she joined Virginia Commonwealth University as assistant professor of dance and media technologies in the dance and choreography and kinetic imaging departments. Prior to this, Sicchio left her home in Philadelphia in 2004 to study for her MA Digital Performance and the University of Hull UK to then go onto teach Dance & Digital Performance at University Centre, Doncaster, UK from 2005-2008 and Dance at the University of East London UK from 2008-2010, and then Dance at the University of Lincoln UK from 2010-2015...
