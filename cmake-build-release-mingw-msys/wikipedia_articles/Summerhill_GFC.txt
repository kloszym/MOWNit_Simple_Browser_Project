== History ==


=== Early history ===
The first GAA club in Summerhill was founded in 1905, little is known about this team and is thought to have disbanded sometime around 1913 or 1914. After this, Summerhill had no local club and many players went to play for teams in nearby towns, mostly going to Bohermeen who were at that time the most prominent team in the county. With local players gone, it would take until 1931 for Summerhill to found another club. The team would go on to many Junior and Intermediate level Championships before gaining success in the Senior Football Championship in the 1970s.


=== 1970s ===
1973 saw Summerhill win their first ever Feis Cup and 1974 proved to be the most memorable year in the history of the club up to that time. Summerhill had beaten Walterstown and Slane, and then beat Kilbride...
