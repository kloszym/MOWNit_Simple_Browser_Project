Colonel Chabert (French: Le colonel Chabert) is a 1943 French drama film directed by René Le Hénaff, starring Raimu, Marie Bell, Aimé Clariond and Jacques Baumer. It tells the story of a French officer who is assumed dead during the Napoleonic Wars, but returns ten years later to a very different France, both on a political and personal level. The film is based on the novel Colonel Chabert by Honoré de Balzac. James Travers has written, "This superlative adaptation of Balzac's great novel was one of a number of prestigious film productions made under the Occupation (1940–1944)."
A later film adaptation of the Balzac story, with Gerard Depardieu in the lead, was released in 1994.
