The A1010 is a road running through north London from Bruce Grove in Tottenham to Waltham Cross. It also used to continue north through Cheshunt to Turnford. The road parallels the A10 Great Cambridge Road to its west.


== Route ==
The southern end of the A1010 is named Tottenham High Road, becoming Fore Street from Upper Edmonton to Edmonton Green. For the northern part the name Hertford Road is used, passing through Ponders End, Enfield Highway, Enfield Wash, Freezywater and Bullsmoor. At Waltham Cross the old route is the pedestrianised High Street, which the designated A1010 by-passes, terminating at the A121. To the north the historic route to Ware is now designated as the B176 and A1170.


== History ==
The road is part of the historic Hertford Road, a route running north from Bishopsgate along the western side of the Lea Valley, through Stoke Newington, Tottenham, Edmonton, Ponders End, Waltham Cross, Cheshunt and Broxbourne to Hoddesdon, where it split into Hertford and Ware branches. The southern end of the Hertford Road between London and Tottenham is thought to follow the Roman Ermine Street and the northern end takes a more easterly course...
