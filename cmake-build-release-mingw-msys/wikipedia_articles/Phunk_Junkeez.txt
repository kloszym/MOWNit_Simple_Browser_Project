The Phunk Junkeez is an American rap rock band from Phoenix, Arizona that formed in 1991. The group's original lineup consisted of vocalists Joe Valiente (Soulman) and Kirk Reznik (K-Tel Disco). Other members rotated through over the years. 
The band plays music using a number of different styles, from hardcore punk to trip-hop. They established a strong underground following in the 1990s as one of the first punk rock-based bands to combine elements of funk, hip-hop, and soul, preceding the larger rap rock movement of the decade. The band is notable for being one of the first to include a DJ within a traditional four-piece rock band. 
The Phunk Junkeez released six albums, and they contributed to numerous commercials and film soundtracks. They are perhaps best known for their cover version of the Kiss song "I Love It Loud" from the 1995 Tommy Boy soundtrack. The band has toured extensively throughout the U.S. as well as Europe and Japan.
