Semyon Valeryevich Tokmakov (Russian: Семён Валерьевич Токмаков born 26 July 1975 in Rybinsk, Russia)[1] is a figure in the Russian nationalist movement.  Tokmakov was a leader of the nationalist organization Russian Goal.  He achieved notoriety in 1998 when he and other neo-nazis attacked William Jefferson, a black United States Marine embassy guard in Moscow.  Semyon was arrested for the attack, spending a year and a half in prison.
As of 2004, Tokmakov was referenced as the "youth leader" for Russia's People's National Party (Russia).
The anti-fascist Russian website Freedom-online.narod.ru claims that Tokmakov was born in the city of Rybinsk in 1978, and worked as a security guard and bank protector there.
