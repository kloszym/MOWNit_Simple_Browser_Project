The Aqaba–Amman Water Desalination and Conveyance Project (AAWDC), also known as the National Water Carrier of Jordan, is a major infrastructure project planned to solve Jordan’s ongoing water shortage. The project involves the desalination of seawater from the Red Sea at Aqaba that will then be transported to Amman and other highland regions across the country. This is the largest water project the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has ever planned. It is seen as a major solution to the country’s national water security and climate adaptation strategy.


== Overview ==
The AAWDC project aims to produce about 300 million cubic meters of clean drinking water each year by removing salt from seawater using reverse osmosis. This water will be carried through a pipeline over 300 kilometers, crossing high terrain to reach the capital city of Amman and other nearby towns and villages. With a planned capacity of 851,000 cubic meters of water per day, it will be the second largest desalination plant in the world, built all at once.
