Albert Toddey, who daydreams of being a James Bond-type secret agent, recalls in flashback how he came to be a "government employee with a position of responsibility":

While Desirée, a stripper, performs. Albert notices an off-stage argument between the attractive Stella and bouncer Harry, and daydreams of overpowering Harry and rescuing her. Acting on this impulse, he is instead drenched in the water from a mop-bucket, and – along with Stella, who was caught going through the boss's desk – is thrown out into the street. 
Stella takes pity on him and asks him back to her apartment to dry off; but, as he changes, Stella is kidnapped by Harry. She manages to indicate to Albert that he should find a book...
