Duckett's Grove (Irish: Garr√°n Duckett) is a ruined 19th-century great house and former estate in County Carlow, Ireland. Belonging to the Duckett family, the house was formerly the focal point of a 12,000-acre (49 km2) estate, and dominated the local landscape of the area for more than two centuries.

The surrounding gardens, including two inter-connecting walled gardens, are now managed by Carlow County Council and open as a public park.
