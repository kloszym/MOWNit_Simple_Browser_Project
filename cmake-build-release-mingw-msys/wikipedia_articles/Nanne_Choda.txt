Nanne Choda (Telugu: నన్నె చోడుడు) was a 12th century Telugu poet renowned for composing the famous work Kumara Sambhavam. He holds the titles Tekanadityudu (టెంకాణాదిత్యుడు) and Kaviraja Sikhamani (కవిరాజ శిఖామణి). He is regarded as the first composer of Prabandha. The trio of Nanne Choda, Mallikarjuna Panditaradhya and Palkuriki Somanatha are referred as Śivakavitrayam (i.e. Trio of Saivite Poets). These trio along with Piduparthi poets and Yathavakkula Annamayya pioneered Veera Saiva movement in Andhra region.

The exact timeline of Nannechoda's life is debated in Telugu literary circles. Chilukuri Veerabhadra Rao suggested that he lived between 925-940 CE. He based this on a particular verse, indicating that Telugu poetry flourished a hundred years before Nannaya. However, due to various interpretations of that verse and the uncertainty regarding its authenticity, Veturi Prabhakara Sastry concluded that it is difficult to prove Nannechoda's antiquity compared to Nannaya. The similarity between verses in 12th-century Somnatha's works and Nannechoda's Kumara Sambhavam has led scholars to believe they might have lived around the same period.
