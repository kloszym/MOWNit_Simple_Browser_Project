Mann was born in Winchmore Hill, Middlesex. During World War I he was an officer of the Scots Guards and was three times wounded and three times mentioned in dispatches.  He died, aged 76, in Milton Lilbourne, Wiltshire.
His son, George Mann, also captained Middlesex County Cricket Club and England, making them the first father and son to have each captained Middlesex and, moreover, the first to have each captained England, at cricket. Simon Mann, the security expert and mercenary, was his grandson.
