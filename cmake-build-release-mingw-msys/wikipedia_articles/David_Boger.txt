David Vernon Boger  (born 13 November 1939) is an Australian chemical engineer.
In 2017, Boger was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for discoveries and fundamental research on elastic and particulate fluids and their application to waste minimization in the minerals industry.


== Life ==
He graduated from Bucknell University with a B.S. where he studied with Robert Slonaker, and from University of Illinois with an M.S. and Ph.D.
He teaches at Monash University, the University of Melbourne, and the University of Florida. He is one of three inaugural Laureate Professors at the University of Melbourne.


== Work ==
Boger is known for his studies of non-Newtonian fluids (which behave both as liquids and solids) which have improved the understanding of how this group of fluids flow and led to major financial and environmental benefits. Boger discovered 'perfect' non-Newtonian fluids, which are elastic and have constant viscosity and are now known as Boger fluids, which enabled him to explain how non-Newtonian fluids behave. He was able to apply his ideas to improve the disposal of "red mud", a toxic waste produced during the manufacture of aluminium from bauxite and a...
