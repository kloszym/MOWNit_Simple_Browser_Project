Ferhad Pasha Sokolović (Turkish: Sokollu Ferhat Paşa, Serbian Cyrillic: Ферхад-паша Соколовић, romanized: Ferhad-paša Sokolović) (died 1590) was an Ottoman general and statesman from Bosnia. He was the last sanjak-bey of Bosnia and first beylerbey of Bosnia.


== Origin ==
Born into the Sokolović family, he was, like his close relative Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha (Mehmed-paša Sokolović) abducted as part of the devşirme system of collection of Christian boys to be raised to serve in the janissary corps, Islamized and recruited into Ottoman service. While one part of the family became Islamized, the other stayed Christian; notably, another relative (possibly Mehmed's brother), Makarije Sokolović, was appointed as a Serbian Patriarch by Mehmed Pasha, who with the support of the Sultan had revived the Patriarchate of Peć. Ferhad was the son of Rustem-beg and had brothers Derviš-beg and Ali-beg Sokolović, the sanjakbey of Klis. His brother Derviš-beg died during an Ottoman battle in Georgia while he was serving as the beylerbey of the Diyarbekir Eyalet, Eastern Anatolia. He is first mentioned as the sanjakbey of Klis and was active in battles around Dalmatia.
