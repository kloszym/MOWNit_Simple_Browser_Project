The epidemiology of depression has been studied across the world.
Depression is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, as the epidemiology has shown. Lifetime prevalence estimates vary widely, from 3% in Japan to 17% in India.

For most countries among the 10 studied, the number of people who experience depression during their lifetimes falls within an 8–12% range.
In North America, the probability of having a major depressive episode within any year-long period is 3–5% for males and 8–10% for females.
