The Bank of New Zealand Te Aro branch building is a historic building on the corner of Manners and Cuba Street, Wellington, New Zealand.
The building, designed by William Turnbull (son of Thomas Turnbull), is one of Wellington's earliest reinforced concrete and steel structures. It features Corinthian columns and ornate projecting cornice. It was refurbished in the early 1980s.
The building, classified as a Category 1 Historic Place (places of "special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value") by Heritage New Zealand, housed a Burger King restaurant until April 2020.
