TRIP13 is a mammalian gene that encodes the thyroid receptor-interacting protein 13. In budding yeast, the analog for TRIP13 is PCH2. TRIP13 is a member of the AAA+ ATPase family, a family known for mechanical forces derived from ATP hydrolase reactions. The TRIP13 gene has been shown to interact with a variety of proteins and implicated in a few diseases, notably interacting with the ligand binding domain of thyroid hormone receptors, and may play a role in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. However, recent evidence implicates TRIP13 in various cell cycle phases, including meiosis G2/Prophase and during the Spindle Assembly checkpoint (SAC). Evidence shows regulation to occur through the HORMA domains, including Hop1, Rev7, and Mad2. Of note, Mad2's involvement in the SAC is shown to be affected by TRIP13  Due to TRIP13's role in cell cycle arrest and progression, it may present opportunity as a therapeutic candidate for cancers.

As an AAA+ ATPase, TRIP13 (and its PCH2 analog) forms homohexamers and interacts with ATP as an energy source. With respect to Hop1, PCH2 binds to and structurally changes Hop1, displacing the Hop1 from DNA. TRIP13/PCH2 interacts with...
