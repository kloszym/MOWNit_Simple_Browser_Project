== Reception ==

Jason Ankeny of AllMusic awarded Koro three out of five stars. Sonic Boom praised the band for sounding even more successful in a live setting, saying "the amount of power and emotion that David Collings brings with his vocals and the atmosphere that Don is able to create with his mixture of guitar and keyboards throughout will definitely make you wish that you could see them live, even if you already have."
