"I'm Not Your Hero" is a song written, recorded and performed by Canadian duo Tegan and Sara and produced by Greg Kurstin for the album Heartthrob (2013). Recorded at Echo Studio and EastWest Studios in California in 2012, it was released on October 21 of that year as a promotional single. The lyrics for the new wave synthpop ballad were written by Sara Quin, and discuss her teenage life in the 1990s when she was unable to identify with the lives of pop culture figures and had unforeseen thoughts about her later life. Guitar chords, drums, bass guitar, synths and harmonized vocals are also played in the track.
"I'm Not Your Hero" was mostly well received by critics for its songwriting and composition. The track garnered comparisons to the works of Santigold, Fleetwood Mac and The Temper Trap. Commercially, it peaked at number 58 on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 and 157 on the French SNEP singles chart. Tegan and Sara have performed it at the Austin City Limits Music Festival, their Let's Make Things Physical tour, and on shows and services such as Soundcheck and Queen's TV.
