Shelfield (Medieval Latin: Scelfeld, Old English: Scylfhyll, Middle English: Shelfhull) is a hamlet in the parish of Aston Cantlow, Warwickshire. While a small hamlet today, Shelfield was its own manor throughout the 14th and 15th centuries. Containing about a dozen cottages, Shelfield today is best known for its culture of equestrianism, its handful of Grade II listed buildings, and until 2013 it was also a home to the Baron Kilmaine. The name Shelfield has its linguistic roots in Old English words scylf and hyll, which translate as 'shelf' and 'hill' respectively, and so the name could be translated as 'shelf hill' or 'hill with a plateau.' While this Shelfield in Warwickshire is not listed in the Domesday Book, another Shelfield in Staffordshire is mentioned as containing a hide of waste belonging to the Manor of Walsall.
Transliterating the Domesday Book Latin the entry reads: In Scelfeld est hida vasta pertinens eidem Manerio. In English: In Shelfield there is one hide of waste appertaining to the said Manor. This interpretation is further justified by a 1469 quitclaim in Walsall which records a witness named Richard Scelfelde; implying 'Scelfelde' is the ablative form of Scelfeld...
