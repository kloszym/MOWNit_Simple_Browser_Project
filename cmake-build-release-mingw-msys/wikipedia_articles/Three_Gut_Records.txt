Three Gut Records was a Guelph, Ontario, Canada based independent record label. It was founded in 1999 by Lisa Moran and Tyler Clark Burke as a vehicle for releasing albums by their friends; it became an influential player in Canadian music with the breakout success of the Constantines' self-titled 2001 release on the label. Three Gut releases were distributed by Outside Music.
Other artists who released music on Three Gut include Royal City, Cuff the Duke, Jim Guthrie, Sea Snakes and Gentleman Reg. The label's name came from their first release, Guthrie's A Thousand Songs, which included a song called "The Fantabulous World of Jimmy 3-Guts", a title derived from reversing the syllables in Guthrie's surname.
Three Gut was also the Canadian label for two albums by the American band Oneida, the only non-Canadian act to have released material on Three Gut.
In 2005, it was announced that Three Gut Records would no longer release new albums.
