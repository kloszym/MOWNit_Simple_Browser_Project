Old Hickory Lake is a reservoir in north central Tennessee.  It is formed by the Old Hickory Lock and Dam (36°17′48″N 86°39′20″W), located on the Cumberland River at mile 216.2 in Sumner and Davidson counties, approximately 25 miles (40 km) upstream from Nashville.
The city of Hendersonville is situated on the northern shoreline of the lake, and Old Hickory, a portion of Metropolitan Nashville-Davidson County, is located on the southern side of the lake, just upstream of the lock and dam. The lake extends 97.3 miles (156.6 km) upstream to Cordell Hull Lock and Dam (36°17′25″N 85°56′36″W), near Carthage, Tennessee.  The dam and lake are named after President Andrew Jackson (nicknamed "Old Hickory"), who lived in the vicinity, at The Hermitage.
The lock, dam, powerhouse and lake are operated and supervised by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff under the direction of the District Engineer at Nashville. Construction started in January 1952, and dam closure was completed in June 1954.
