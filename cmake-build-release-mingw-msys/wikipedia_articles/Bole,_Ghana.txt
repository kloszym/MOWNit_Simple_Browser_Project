== History ==
Bole was founded as a trading center by Soninke Wangara immigrants, the same group that were the progenitors of the Dyula of Begho, Bouna, Bondoukou and Kong. The town was located on an important regional trade route for kola nuts linking the Manding region with Hausaland, and was a part of the Gonja kingdom.
In 1818 Bole fought a war against the Ashanti Empire. When they lost, the victors deposed the ruling Timite family of imams and replaced them with the Kamaghate. The Bolewura, leader of the historical Bole chiefdom and current Traditional Area, moved his seat to Bole in 1868.
