The Taurus Void is a vast, near-empty region of space situated between the Perseus–Pisces Supercluster and the Virgo Supercluster. The Taurus void is unique because of its relatively close proximity to Earth, and because it helps to define the edge of latter's home supercluster, the Virgo Supercluster. Despite its close proximity to Earth, the Taurus Void is not well-studied because it is partially obscured by the Milky Way when viewed from Earth. In contrast to its ambiguous boundary in the section of sky obscured by the Milky Way, the Taurus Void has a very well-defined boundary with the Perseus–Pisces supercluster.


== Location ==
In Earth's sky, the Taurus Void appears from ~2h40min to at least 4h ra, at which point it is obscured by the Milky Way, and from 5° to 40° dec. Opposite its border with the Milky Way, the Taurus Void forms a distinct border with the Perseus-Pisces supercluster. Specifically, the void is bordered by the galaxy clusters A400, A426, and A374 within the supercluster.
In 3D space, the Taurus Void resides between the Perseus–Pisces Supercluster and our own Virgo Supercluster. By situating itself between these two superclusters, the Taurus Void, along with the...
