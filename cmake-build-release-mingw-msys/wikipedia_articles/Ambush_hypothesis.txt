The ambush hypothesis is a hypothesis in the field of molecular genetics that suggests that the prevalence of “hidden” or off-frame stop codons in DNA selectively deters off-frame translation of mRNA to save energy, molecular resources, and to reduce strain on biosynthetic machinery by truncating the production of non-functional, potentially cytotoxic protein products. Typical coding sequences of DNA lack in-frame internal stop codons to avoid the premature reduction of protein products when translation proceeds normally. The ambush hypothesis suggests that kinetic, cis-acting mechanisms are responsible for the productive frameshifting of translational units so that the degeneracy of the genetic code can be used to prevent deleterious translation. Ribosomal slippage is the most well described mechanism of translational frameshifting where the ribosome moves one codon position either forward (+1) or backward (-1) to translate the mRNA sequence in a different reading frame and thus produce different protein products.
In respect to codon usage, the ambush hypothesis theorizes that there is a positive correlation between the use of a codon and the amount a codon contributes to hidden stops...
