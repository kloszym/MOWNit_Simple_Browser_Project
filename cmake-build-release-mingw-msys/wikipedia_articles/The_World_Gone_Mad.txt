== Plot ==
When a district attorney who has been investigating a utility company's directors for fraud is suddenly killed, his wisecracking newspaperman friend (Pat O'Brien) gets curious. He and the upstanding new district attorney (Neil Hamilton) separately pursue the case. Cultivated but sinister businessmen, a shady nightclub owner specializing in "import and export", several beautiful young women always seen in evening gowns, a "Latin lover" type who reads Casanova and an abundance of suave men in evening dress provide eye-candy for the duration.
