== Critical reception ==

AllMusic editor Michael Gallucci rated the album one and a half a stars out of five. He wrote: "Martinez's day job is as a DJ at a N.Y.C. hip-hop station, and her second album is reason enough for her not to quit. Devoid of style and anything to say, Martinez merely recites her rhymes over flaccid beats, hoping to hook on to something. She falls into nearly all of hip-hop's traps (thankfully, she keeps Animal House at a reasonable 45 minutes): overwrought R&B choruses, lame-ass skits, and "featured" turns by guest-rapping B-listers."
