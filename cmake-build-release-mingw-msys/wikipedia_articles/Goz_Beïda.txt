Goz Beïda (Arabic: قوز بيدا) is a town located in eastern Chad. It is the capital of the Sila region and the Kimiti department. Prior to 2008, Goz Beïda was part of the Ouaddaï Region's former Sila Department.
It is situated about 70 kilometres (43 mi) from the border with Sudan's western Darfur Region, and 1,200 km by road from N'Djamena, the Chadian capital. The town is served by Goz Beïda Airport.
Due to its proximity to Sudan, Goz Beïda holds a geographically strategic location, both for cross-border trade and as a transit point during regional crises, frequently receiving an influx of refugees from the neighboring country.


== History ==
The name Goz Beïda derives from the combination of the Chadian Arabic words Goz (sand) and Beïda (white), literally meaning "white sand". Indeed, the town stretches out, shaded by some large trees, over white sand surrounded by ochre rocks. Sultan Hyssac Habreche is said to have given this name to the region in the 16th century.
Goz Beïda maintains historical ties with the Daju, an Islamized people from southern Ouaddaï, and is home to the tata of Goz Beïda, the residence of the Sultan of Daju. The town was also part of the Ouaddaï Empire.
