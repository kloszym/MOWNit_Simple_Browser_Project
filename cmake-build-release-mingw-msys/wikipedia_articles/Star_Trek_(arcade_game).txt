Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is a space combat simulation arcade video game based on the original Star Trek television program and movie series, and released by Sega in 1983. Star Trek uses color vector graphics for both a 2D display and a 3D first-person perspective. The player controls the Starship Enterprise and must defend sectors from invading Klingon ships. The game includes synthesized speech
The game was manufactured in two styles of cabinets: an upright standup, and a sit-down/semi-enclosed deluxe cabinet with the player's chair modeled after the Star Trek: The Motion Picture's bridge chairs with controls integrated into the chair's arms.
Star Trek was ported to the  Commodore 64, TI-99/4A, Atari 8-bit computers, Atari 5200, Atari 2600, VIC-20, ColecoVision, and Apple II.


== Gameplay ==
The player is presented with multiple views of the play field. Survival depends on the player's ability to effectively use and manage shield energy, photon torpedoes, and warp energy. These are replenished by docking with starbases, which sometimes must be saved from destruction at the hands of the Klingons.
The controls use a weighted spinner for ship heading control and buttons...
