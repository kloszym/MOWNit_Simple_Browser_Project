Quintus Glitius Atilius Agricola was a Roman senator and general who held several posts in the emperor's service. He was twice suffect consul: for the first time in AD 97 with Lucius Pomponius Sura as his colleague, and the second time in 103 when he replaced the emperor Trajan. He is the last known person to have held two suffect consulates. Agricola is known only through a large number of fragmentary inscriptions from Augusta Taurinorum, which appears to be his home town.
His full name, father's praenomen (Publius) and tribe (Stellatina) are known from these inscriptions. It is often assumed that Agricola was the son or grandson of the equestrian officer Glitius Barbarus, who is attested as living in 48 or 49, but Olli Salomies notes that his father's praenomen is attested as Publius, then argues that it makes better sense to assume that his name at birth was Atilius Agricola and he was afterwards adopted by a Q. Glitius.
