The West Indies cricket team toured Australia in the 2000–01 cricket season. They played five Test matches against Australia, and also competed in a triangular One Day International series that also involved Zimbabwe.


== Test series ==
Australia won the Test series 5–0, the first time the West Indies had been whitewashed by Australia since the 1930–31 series.

The one day series, sponsored by Carlton & United Beverages, was played between Australia, Zimbabwe and the West Indies. The West Indies and Australia qualified for the finals, in which Australia won the first two matches in Melbourne and Sydney. Hence a deciding final match was not required.
