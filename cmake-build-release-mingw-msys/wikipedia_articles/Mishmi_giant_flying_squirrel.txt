The Mishmi giant flying squirrel (Petaurista mishmiensis) is a species of rodent in the family Sciuridae. First described in 2009 from East Himalayan forests at altitudes of 600–1,600 m (2,000–5,200 ft) in the Mishmi Hills of northeastern Arunachal Pradesh in India (it might also occur just across the border in neighbouring China), the taxonomic status and position of this giant flying squirrel is not fully resolved.
