The Illinoian Stage is the name used by Quaternary geologists in North America to designate the Penultimate Glacial Period c.191,000 to c.130,000 years ago, during the late Middle Pleistocene (Chibanian), when sediments comprising the Illinoian Glacial Lobe were deposited. It precedes the Sangamonian Stage (corresponding to the global Last Interglacial) and follows the Pre-Illinoian Stage in North America. The Illinoian Stage is defined as the period of geologic time during which the glacial tills and outwash, which comprise the bulk of the Glasford Formation, accumulated to create the Illinoian Glacial Lobe. 


== Definition ==
At its type exposure in Peoria County, Illinois, the Illinoian deposits consist of three till members of the Glasford Formation. They overlay Pre-Illinoian tills of the Banner Formation, in which the Yarmouth Soil (paleosol) has developed. In this exposure, the Illinoian Glasford Formation, in which the interglacial Sangamon Soil (palesosol) has developed, is overlain by early Wisconsinan stage loess, called the Roxana Silt.  A paleosol, called the Pike Soil, separates two of the till members within the Glasford Formation.
