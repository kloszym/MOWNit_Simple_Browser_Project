Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is a 2001 action role-playing game developed and published by Konami for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console. The game was developed as a stand-alone title in the Castlevania series and as a launch title for the Game Boy Advance.
The game's plot follows a vampire hunter named Nathan Graves as he attempts to rescue his mentor from the clutches of Dracula. Following the Metroidvania style of gameplay established by Castlevania: Symphony of the Night,  Circle of the Moon expands on the magic attack mechanics of the former with the Dual Set-Up System, which allows for attacks to be mixed and matched by players as they see fit.
The game sold 500,000 units worldwide and received critical acclaim, with praise for its world design, mechanics, and scope, while some criticized the dark visuals. Circle of the Moon was re-released as part of the Castlevania Advance Collection on September 23, 2021, for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One alongside Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance, Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, and Castlevania: Dracula X.
