Rin Rin the tadpole (Spanish: Rin Rin Renacuajo), also known as the tripping tadpole (El renacuajo paseador) (1884) is a stock character created by Colombian poet Rafael Pombo. It is still reprinted in compilations of children stories and nursery rhymes.


== History ==
Rin Rin the tadpole represents the stereotype of the self-assured youth, never listening to his elders.  He is depicted in an aristocratic dandy fashion ("With short pants, a stylish necktie, hat with ribbons and a wedding frock coat").  His mother (naturally, a frog) asks him not to leave the house, but he doesn't listen to her.  The companions in his adventures are a young mouse ("el Niño Ratico"), and an old lady rat ("Doña Ratona"). They go around, partying and drinking beer.  Finally, due to this misconduct, they end tragically, devoured by predators. The mouse and rat were eaten by cats while the frog was devoured by a duck.
