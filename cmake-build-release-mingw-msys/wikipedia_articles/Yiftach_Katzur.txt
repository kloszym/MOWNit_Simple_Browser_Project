Yiftach Katzur  (Hebrew: יפתח קצור, sometimes spelled Yftach Katzur), also known in Germany as Jesse Katzur) is an Israeli actor, director, producer, and business strategist, born on July 17, 1958, in Israel. He gained international fame for his role as Benji (Bentzi) in the popular Israeli film series Lemon Popsicle (Eis am Stiel)—an eight-part coming-of-age comedy that began in 1978 and became a cultural phenomenon in Israel and beyond. Lemon Popsicle (Hebrew: אסקימו לימון, romanized: Eskimo Limon) is a 1978 teen comedy-drama film co-written and directed by Boaz Davidson. It became the most commercially successful Israeli film of all time, leading to the production of several sequels. The cult film follows a group of three teenage boys in early-1960s Tel Aviv. Katzur’s character, the shy and sensitive member of a trio of teenage friends, was based on the series’ director, Boaz Davidson.
