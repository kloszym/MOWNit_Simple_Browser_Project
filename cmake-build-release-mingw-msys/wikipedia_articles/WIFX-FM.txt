== History ==
The station went on the air as WREM-FM on May 10, 1975. As a newly launched companion station for WREM (AM 1000, later WKVG), it originally broadcast a variety format.
On November 23, 1981, the station changed its call sign to the current WIFX. It began airing a Top 40 format the same year. Sometime later in that decade, it began airing its current Hot AC format.
In May 2013, the station launched "Foxy and Friends", a local morning show to replace John Boy and Billy, which was moved to a sister station. "Foxy and Friends" features hosts Tiffany, Tim, and Jake.
