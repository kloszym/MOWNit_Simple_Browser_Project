The ambassador of the Kingdom of England to Sweden was the foremost diplomatic representative of the historic Kingdom of England in Sweden, before the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. The title was more often Envoy extraordinary than ambassador. (The first two on this list, Bulstrode Whitelocke and William Jephson, in fact represented Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth of England which at the time displaced the Monarchy.)
The position was not always a continuous or permanent one, and there was sometimes no diplomatic representation between the two countries.
For ambassadors from the Court of St. James's to Sweden after the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, see List of ambassadors of Great Britain to Sweden.
