The Christie, formerly known as Christie Hospital and The Christie Hospital and Holt Radium Institute, is a specialist National Health Service (NHS) single site cancer centre in Manchester, United Kingdom. The hospital is managed by The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, which as of 2024 had a turnover of £472 million and around 3,500 staff. Its work is supported by The Christie Charity.
The hospital was established in 1890 by Richard Copley Christie, after whom, along with his wife Mary, it is named. Initially situated off Oxford Road in Manchester, the centre moved to a purpose-built facility in Withington in 1932 and became part of the NHS in 1948.
