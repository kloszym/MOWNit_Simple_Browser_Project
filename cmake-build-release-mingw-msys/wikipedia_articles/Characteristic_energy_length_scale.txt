The characteristic energy length scale 
  
    
      
        χ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi }
  
 describes the size of the region from which energy flows to a rapidly moving crack.  If material properties change within the characteristic energy length scale, local wave speeds can dominate crack dynamics.  This can lead to supersonic fracture.
