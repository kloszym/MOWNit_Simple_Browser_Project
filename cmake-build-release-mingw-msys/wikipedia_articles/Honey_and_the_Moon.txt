"Honey and the Moon" is a single from Joseph Arthur. The song originally appeared on Joseph's third studio album, Redemption's Son, and was released as a radio-only promo single in 2003, but was remixed for a 2007 commercial single release. The B-sides are the album versions of two songs taken from two of Joseph's new releases, 2006's Nuclear Daydream, and 2007's Let's Just Be. The song was also featured on the FOX teen-drama series The O.C., and in the 2003 movie American Wedding.
