The Élan was a popular snowmobile variant of Ski-Doo built by Bombardier from 1971 to 1996.  They were offered a rather large variety of options including 1 or 2-cylinder engines, different designs on the hood, and other choices. In 1971 the Elans originally came with Rotax engines 250cc (247cc) single-cylinder rated at 12 hp which had the options of having an electric start as well as a recoil starter.  In 1973, they introduced 2 new engines, a 250cc (247cc) twin-cylinder rated at 16 hp had a standard muffler and a single HR carb, and the SS model that was a 250 (247cc) twin-cylinder rated at 22 hp with dual HR carbs, tuned exhaust, disc brake, and new standard chrome bumper.
Because of its basic, cheap design, the Élan was long popular with hunters, trappers, and those living in the far north, where certain repair parts (such as a CDI) for other newer sleds could fail, would be harder to obtain, and could leave their riders stranded.  
The Elan snowmobile was used in Antarctica at McMurdo Station.
