4833 Meges  is a large Jupiter trojan from the Greek camp, approximately 85 kilometers (53 miles) in diameter. It was discovered on 8 January 1989, by American astronomer Carolyn Shoemaker at the Palomar Observatory in California. The D-type asteroid belongs to the 40 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 14.25 hours. It was named after Meges from Greek mythology.


== Orbit and classification ==
Meges is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's L4 Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of its orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population.
It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.8–5.7 AU once every 12.01 years (4,387 days; semi-major axis of 5.24 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 35° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as 1975 XN5 at Crimea–Nauchnij in December 1975. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Palomar in January 1989.
