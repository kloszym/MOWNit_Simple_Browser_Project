== History ==
The MV Aegean Odyssey was built in 1973 as the Zim ro-ro ferry Narcis, later renamed Alkyon in 1985. In 1986, she was bought by Dolphin Hellas Cruises, which renamed the ship Aegean Dolphin and sent it to Perama to be converted into a cruise ship. Following the completion of renovations in 1988, the ship remained in the cruise line's fleet until 1995, when she was sold to Epirotiki Line. It was renamed Aegean I whilst on charter to Renaissance Cruises in 1996. Then the ship operated for Golden Sun Cruises on Mediterranean cruises since 1997â€“1998, still owned by Dolphin Hellas. In 2005, she was to be bought by Louis Hellenic Cruise Lines, but the deal fell through due to legal problems, and the ship was laid up.
She was bought by the new cruise company 'Voyages to Antiquity' in 2009, as part of a new venture by cruise line veteran Gerry Herrod. The cruise was operated by Turkish travel agency Etstur in 2013 and 2015 summer seasons for Greek Islands...
