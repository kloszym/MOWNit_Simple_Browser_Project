The Titular Archbishopric of Gabala, formerly the Diocese of Gabala, is a titular archbishopric of the Roman Catholic Church named for its former see, the city of Jableh, in present-day Syria.


== Greek bishopric ==
No later than the 4th century, Gabala became a bishopric in the Roman province of Syria Prima, suffragan of the Archdiocese of Seleucia Pieria. Later it was raised to a Byzantine autocephalous Archbishopric, remaining within the sway of the original Patriarchate of Antioch, apparently until the Muslims conquered all Syria. Holders of the bishopric included:

Zoilus (recorded in 325)
Severus (circa 347)
Domninus (in 381)
Severianus (early 5th century)
Maras
Pietro/Peter (first mention 451 - last 458)
Giovanni/John (in 536)
Romanus (in 553)
Germanus


== Latin bishopric ==
When the Crusaders conquered Gabala, it became a Latin bishopric in the Principality of Antioch, one of the Crusader States, until its capture by Saladin in 1189 during the Third Crusade, apparently under the Latin Patriarchate of Antioch. Holders of the see included:

William/Guglielmo (recorded in 1115)
Hugo/Ugo (first mention 1136 - last 1144)
V. (in 1179)
Radulfo (in 1261)
Gualterio di Calabria, Dominican...
