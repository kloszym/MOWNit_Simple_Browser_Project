The Újlaki family (Croatian: Iločki; Croatian pronunciation: [ilotʃki]), in old sources de Illoch, de Wylak, de Voilack etc., Hungarian: Újlaki) was a Croatian–Hungarian noble family, descended in the male line from Gug (in some sources Göge), a member of the lower nobility in the region of Lower Slavonia during the 13th century.
The Újlaki or Iločki, meaning "those of Ilok" (Hungarian: Újlak), rose to be a powerful and influential family in the Kingdom of Hungary and Croatia during the period in the Late Middle Ages history marked by dynastic struggles for the possession of the throne and the Ottoman wars in Europe that affected the country. Notable members of the family were Bans of Croatia, Voivodes of Transylvania, Palatines of Hungary, ispáns or župans (counts), king's chamberlains and king's chief retainers. One of them, Nicholas Újlaki, the most powerful and most famous member of the family, was nominal King of Bosnia from 1471 until 1477.
