Calysta is a multinational biotechnology firm based in San Mateo, California. The company develops industrial processes that utilize microorganisms to convert methane into protein for seafood,  livestock feed and other food ingredients. It operates a demonstration plant in Teesside, England, that uses methanotroph bacteria to convert methane into single cell protein currently approved for use in fish and livestock feed in the European Union. The firm is a spinout of DNA 2.0, the largest US-based provider of synthetic genes for industrial and academic use.


== History ==
Calysta was founded in 2012 in Menlo Park, California by Josh Silverman, and is led by CEO Alan Shaw.
By June 2013, the firm began working with NatureWorks to use methane fermentation to produce lactic acid. However, its main technology is based on a similar method developed in the 1980s by Statoil, an unrelated and state-owned energy company in Norway. In 2014, Calysta purchased and further developed the technology for producing animal feed ingredients. Using the ten-million-dollar total funding from investors including Aqua-Spark, Calysta began a  study to determine the viability of a mass production facility.
