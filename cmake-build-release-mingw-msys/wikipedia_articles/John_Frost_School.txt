In August 2019, in the BBC TV series Who Do You Think You Are?, the school was visited by TV producer Michael Whitehall and his son, actor and comedian Jack Whitehall, who were revealed to be descendants of Thomas Phillips, mayor of Newport at the time of the Rising.
In 2005, the school was used for filming the Doctor Who television episode "School Reunion". Some of the school's pupils were used as extras.
