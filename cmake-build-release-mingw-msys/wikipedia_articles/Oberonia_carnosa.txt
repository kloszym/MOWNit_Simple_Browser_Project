Oberonia carnosa is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb with between four and six fleshy, light green leaves 15–25 mm (0.59–0.98 in) long, 5–8 mm (0.20–0.31 in) wide and curved with their bases overlapping. A large number of orange to orange brown flowers about 1.7 mm (0.067 in) long and 1.0 mm (0.039 in) wide are arranged in whorls on an arching or hanging flowering stem 30–60 mm (1.2–2.4 in) long. The flowering stem has whorls of tiny bracts near its base. The sepals and petals are egg-shaped and spread widely apart from each other, the petals with teeth on their edges and the sepals curved backwards. The labellum is about 1 mm (0.039 in) long and 0.6 mm (0.024 in) wide with three obscure lobes that often have teeth on the tip. Flowering occurs between February and June.
