Qaṣr al-Badi'a (Arabic: قصر البديعة, romanized: Qaṣr al-Badiʿa) is a royal palace in the al-Badi'ah neighbourhood in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It was erected outside the old town in the 1930s at the behest of King ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz Ibn Saud. The building stands on the bank of Wadi Hanifa. It served as a guesthouse for visiting dignitaries and as the king's summer residence. From 1954 the building served as a police station and school. More recently it has been restored with documentation carried out by Dārah, the King Abdulaziz Foundation for Research and Archives.
