Bacelarella gibbosa is  a species of jumping spider in the genus Bacelarella that is endemic to Nigeria. The spider has a distinctive shape to the carapace that gives the species its name, which can be translated hunchback. It was first described in 2012 by Wanda Wesołowska and Glavis Edwards. The spider is medium-sized with a cephalothorax that has a length between 3.1 and 3.8 mm (0.12 and 0.15 in) and an abdomen that is between 2.6 and 3.4 mm (0.10 and 0.13 in) long. The female is larger than the male. It is also generally lighter in colour, the male having a darker brown carapace, clypeus and legs. The species can be distinguished from others in the species by the male's round small palpal bulb and long thin embolus and the larger pocket in the female's epigyne.
