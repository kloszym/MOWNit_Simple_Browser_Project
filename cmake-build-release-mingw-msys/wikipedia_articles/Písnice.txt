== Geography ==
Písnice consists of two distinct urban areas, separated by an undeveloped strip along the Kunratice bypass road, and its future extension. The southern part, consisting primarily of residential houses, is clustered around the historical village of Písnice. The northern part consists of a tower block housing estate and the grounds of a former meat factory.
Písnice is bordered on the north by Libuš, in the west by the village of Cholupice, on the east by Kunratice and the southeast by Hodkovice and the village of Vestec.
Písnice is home to a culinary vocational school, an elementary school Písnice, and a voluntary fire brigade. The former meat factory site has been transformed into a Vietnamese commercial, logistical, and cultural complex, known as SAPA.
The eastern part of the Modřany Gully park falls within the boundaries of the municipality.
