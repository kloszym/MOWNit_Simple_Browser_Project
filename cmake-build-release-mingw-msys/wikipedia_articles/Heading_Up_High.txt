== Background and release ==
Armin van Buuren declared about the song “I wanted to create a song that was just totally unexpected and I'd been drawn to the sound of Kensington for some time. We really vibed well together and I think my long-time dance music fans may be surprised by some elements of this song. It just really soars and I get a great reaction whenever I play it out! It's got the feel of worlds coming together.”


== Reception ==
According to Amanda Mesa from webmedia Dancing Astronaut, "Infectious and high-energy, “Heading Up High” is yet another example of Embrace’s genre-fluidity. [...] Overall, “Heading Up High” is a roller coaster across intense highs and lows that'll leave you hanging on for more."
