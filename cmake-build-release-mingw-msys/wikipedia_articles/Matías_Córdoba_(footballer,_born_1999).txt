== Career ==
Córdoba began his senior career in Torneo Federal B with Tiro y Gimnasia, a club of his birthplace. He scored three goals in thirty-seven fixtures in the fourth tier between 2014 and 2016, prior to securing a move to Primera B Nacional side Gimnasia y Esgrima in 2017. After twelve months in their reserve set-up, Córdoba moved into the club's first-team ahead of the 2018–19 campaign. His professional debut arrived during a fixture on 25 August with Arsenal de Sarandí, before netting his first goal on 22 September against Santamarina; days after he had signed his first pro contract. He scored four further goals that season.
In September 2020, after seven goals in thirty-six matches for Gimnasia y Esgrima, Córdoba was signed on loan by Primera División outfit Talleres. In January 2022, Talleres triggered the purchase option and signed Córdoba permanently. Due to knee injuries, he wasn't able to play for Talleres and in June 2022, Talleres loaned him out to Deportivo Morón until the end of the year.
