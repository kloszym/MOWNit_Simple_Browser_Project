"Jerk" is a song by American singer Oliver Tree, originally released on July 17, 2020, as part of his debut studio album Ugly Is Beautiful. Upon release, the song largely stood out to music critics reviewing the album. Noted for its "groan haunts", Pitchfork writer Cat Zhang drew comparisons to Billie Joe Armstrong, while NME's Ben Jolly described the song as "an anti-bullying anthem-in-waiting". Tree sings about his experiences of being an outcast and eventually realizes that his hatred for jerks is "a double-edged sword".

German DJ and producer Southstar released a remix of the song on May 9, 2022, titled "Miss You". Due to Southstar using Tree's vocals without permission, it was later re-released with re-recorded vocals as a single on July 30, 2022, through B1. A "sped-up version" of the song was released on October 12, 2022. It debuted at number 88 in Germany and went on to reach the top 10 by October, as well as the top 40 in Austria, Ireland, Lithuania and Switzerland.
