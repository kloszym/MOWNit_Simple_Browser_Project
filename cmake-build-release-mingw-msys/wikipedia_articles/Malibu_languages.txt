The Malibu languages are a poorly attested group of extinct languages once spoken along the Magdalena River in Colombia. Material exists only for two of the numerous languages mentioned in the literature: Malibú and Mocana.


== Classification ==
The Malibu languages have previously been grouped into a single family with the Chimila language.  However, Chimila is now known to be a Chibchan language, and Adelaar & Muysken regard the grouping of Chimila with the Malibu languages as "without any factual basis".


== Family division ==
Rivet listed three Malibu tribes, each with its own language:

Malibú, spoken near the Magdalena River from Tamalameque to Tenerife
Mocaná, spoken by the Mokaná people in the region east of Cartagena (Rivet 1947b; Simón 1882-1892, vol. 4, p. 298, only two words.)
Pacabuey, also known as Sompallón or Laguna Malibu, spoken near the Zapatoza lagoon (Unattested.)
To this list, Loukotka adds six more languages, all of which are unattested (excluding Chimila):

Papale, spoken on the Fundación River
Coanoa or Guanoa, spoken on the Cesar River
Zamirua, spoken on the Ariguaní River
Cospique, spoken somewhere in the Department of Magdalena
Mompox, spoken near the city...
