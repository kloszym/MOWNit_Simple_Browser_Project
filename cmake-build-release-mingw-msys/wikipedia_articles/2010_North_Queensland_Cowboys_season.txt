The 2010 North Queensland Cowboys season was the 16th season in the club's history. Coached by Neil Henry and co-captained by Johnathan Thurston and Matthew Scott, they competed in the National Rugby League's 2010 Telstra Premiership, finishing in 15th place and failing to make the finals for the 3rd consecutive year.


== Season summary ==
Prior to the kick-off of the 2010 season, the media's attention surrounded the Cowboys' signing of ex-Australian international forward, Willie Mason on a one-year deal. The controversial figure was one of the team's most consistent players in 2010 but would leave the Cowboys at season's end to join English Super League side Hull Kingston Rovers.
2010 resulted in a very poor season for the Cowboys who recorded just five wins from 24 matches, although four of those wins came against teams that would participate in the 2010 finals series. Had the Melbourne Storm not been deducted premiership points for salary cap breaches earlier in the year, the Cowboys would have received the wooden spoon. During the season the side went on a three-game losing streak, two four-game losing streaks and ended the season on a run of six straight losses.
