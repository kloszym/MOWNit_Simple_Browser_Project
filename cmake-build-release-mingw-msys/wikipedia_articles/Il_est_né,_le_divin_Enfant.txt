"Il est né, le divin Enfant" (English: He is born, the divine Child) is a traditional French Christmas carol.


== History ==
The melody was published for the first time in 1863 by Jean-Romary Grosjean, organist of the Cathedral of Saint-Dié-des-Vosges, in a collection of carols entitled Airs des noëls lorrains. The text of the carol was published for the first time in a collection of ancient carols, published in either 1875 or 1876 by Dom G. Legeay.


== Lyrics ==
The text of the carol details the birth of Jesus and the wait of 4000 years for this event, as foretold by the prophets. It both observes the humility of Christ's birth in a stable and calls on the Kings of the Orient to attend the child.
The text of the carol has been translated into English numerous times. One translation that is close in meaning is that by Edward Bliss Reed (1930):
Gabriel Fauré wrote several arrangements, including for solo voice and organ (1888), for choir and organ (1923), and for children's choir and chamber orchestra (1938). David Willcocks, John Rutter and Kurt Suttner wrote modern choral versions.
