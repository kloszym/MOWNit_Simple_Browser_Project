Harlem Renaissance is a live album celebrating saxophonist/composer Benny Carter's 85th birthday recorded in 1992 and released by the MusicMasters label.


== Reception ==

"Harlem Renaissance Suite" won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition in 1992. AllMusic reviewer Scott Yanow stated "Benny Carter is a true marvel. At the time of this recording (a double CD), the classic altoist was already age 84, yet showed no signs of slowing down either his playing or his writing schedule. For his specially assembled big band and The Rutgers University Orchestra (which includes a full string section), Carter wrote entirely new arrangements that demonstrate that his talents have not diminished with age. ... In addition, Carter's alto is often the solo star although he does not hog the spotlight; it just naturally drifts back to him".
