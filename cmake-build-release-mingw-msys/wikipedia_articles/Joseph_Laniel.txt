Laniel was born at Vimoutiers in Normandy to a family that ran a successful textile factory.

However, he later joined the French Resistance and was one of the founders of the National Council of the Resistance (CNR).
Co-founder of the Republican Party of Liberty (PRL), then of the National Center of Independents and Peasants (CNIP), Laniel's cabinet was overturned after the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu in Indochina in 1954. He was succeeded by Pierre Mendès France.
