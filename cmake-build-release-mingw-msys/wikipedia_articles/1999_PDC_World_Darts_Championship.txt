The 1999 Skol World Darts Championship was held between 28 December 1998 and 3 January 1999 at the Circus Tavern in Purfleet, Essex. After five years, organisers of the Professional Darts Corporation scrapped the group stages and the tournament became a straight knock-out for the first time. The third-place play-off which had been a feature for the previous two years was also abandoned. The field was expanded from 24 to 32 players – the biggest influx of players since the PDC separated from the British Darts Organisation in 1992–93.
Phil Taylor emerged as champion for the fifth successive year, taking his overall tally to seven World Championships.
