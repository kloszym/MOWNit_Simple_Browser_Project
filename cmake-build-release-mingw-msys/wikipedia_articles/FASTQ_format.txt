FASTQ format is a text-based format for storing both a biological sequence (usually nucleotide sequence) and its corresponding quality scores. Both the sequence letter and quality score are each encoded with a single ASCII character for brevity.
It was originally developed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute to bundle a FASTA formatted sequence and its quality data, but has become the de facto standard for storing the output of high-throughput sequencing instruments such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer.


== Format ==
A FASTQ file has four line-separated fields per sequence:

Field 1 begins with a '@' character and is followed by a sequence identifier and an optional description (like a FASTA title line).
Field 2 is the raw sequence letters.
Field 3 begins with a '+' character and is optionally followed by the same sequence identifier (and any description) again.
Field 4 encodes the quality values for the sequence in Field 2, and must contain the same number of symbols as letters in the sequence.
A FASTQ file containing a single sequence might look like this:

@SEQ_ID
