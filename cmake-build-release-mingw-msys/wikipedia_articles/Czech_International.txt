The Czech Open in badminton is an international open held in the Czech Republic since 1993. This tournament followed the Czechoslovakian Open and is often used by European, in particular Danish, new generation talents as jump board into the European point. In 2018, the Český Badmintonový Svaz held two level 4 tournaments, the International Series in Karviná, and the International Challenge in Brno, which held in March and September, respectively.
