The Politechnika Warszawska PW-6U is a Polish two-seat training sailplane designed at the Warsaw University of Technology for basic flight instruction and transition training to the PW-5 single-seater. It was manufactured at PZL Świdnik from 2000 and at ZS Jezow from 2007.


== Development ==
The PW-6 was designed to be an ab initio trainer with the capability of providing cross-country training as well. It has handling and performance characteristics similar to the Politechnika Warszawska PW-5. In this way, it was envisaged that the transition to solo flying in the single-seater could be made sooner.
The prototype of the PW-6, built at the Politechnika Warszawska, PZL Świdnik and DWLKK, made its maiden flight from Bemowo Airfield, Warsaw, in July 1998. Type certification was granted in September 2000, after Jerzy Kedzierski and Maciej Lasek completed the test flights. Serial production started at PZL Swidnik soon afterwards, with first deliveries to Egypt, New Zealand, Belgium, Canada, United States, Portugal and Germany. Production at PZL Swidnik ceased after approximately 26 aircraft had been completed, but resumed at Zaklad Szybowcowy Jezow in 2007.
