Charles Treweek (12 March 1859 – 17 February 1942) was a New Zealand civil servant and cricketer. He played in two first-class matches for Canterbury, one in 1889–90 and the other in 1894–95.
Treweek was born at Kai Iwi near Whanganui in 1859. His parents had been some of the earliest settlers of the Taranaki Region, arriving in New Zealand on the Timandra in 1842, and Treweek was the youngest of 12 children. Educated at Whanganui, he worked in a legal office after leaving school before joining the Telegraph Department in 1875.
Working initially at Wellington, Treweek became a skilled telegraph operator. He later worked at Blenheim and Christchurch before being ported to chief telegraph clerk at Nelson. He moved to be senior check clerk and later assistant-superintendent at Wellington, before being promoted to superintendent of telegraphs at Auckland in 1920 where he worked until he retired in 1921. Considered "one of the most brilliant telegraphists of his day", he sent 24,500 words in 19 hours following the grounding of the SS Taiaroa in 1886, one of the "most notable feats in New Zealand telegraphy".
