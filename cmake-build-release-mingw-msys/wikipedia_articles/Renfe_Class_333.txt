The Renfe Series 333 are high power six-axle diesel-electric locomotives built in the 1970s; at the time of their introduction they were the most powerful non-electric locomotives in Spain.
After three decades of service the class were rebuilt incorporating Alstom's newer technology, and thus extending their life - these rebuilt machines were given the sub-class names 333.3 and 333.4


== Background ==
In the early 1970s, Renfe's dieselization program, with classes 316 (former 1600) and 318 (former 1800) CC locomotives, later followed by the more numerous classes 319 (former 1900) and 321 (former 2100), had displaced steam-powered traction and were responsible for much of the work requiring medium-powered locomotives. On the other hand, diesel-hydraulic class 340 (former 4000), based on the German V 200, initially intended for hauling express trains at the Madrid-Barcelona railway and other non-electrified lines, were suffering many failures from poor maintenance and being assigned to slow cargo trains. This is why Renfe was looking for a new diesel engined locomotive capable of both hauling express trains and high-tonnage heavy freight trains nationwide at a maximum speed of 62 mph....
