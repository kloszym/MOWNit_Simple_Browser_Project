Molpadiidae is a family of sea cucumbers, marine invertebrates with elongated bodies, leathery skins and tentacles that are found on or burrowing in the sea floor.


== Description ==
Members of Molpadiidae are fairly small, plump sea cucumbers with a smooth or slimy skin and no tube feet. They are relatively inactive and live in a U-shaped burrow in sand or mud at the bottom of the sea, often at considerable depths. Their tentacles spread out above the sediment to catch food particles.
