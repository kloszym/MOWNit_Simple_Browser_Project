Seaford House, previously Sefton House, is a former aristocratic mansion and the largest of the detached town houses sited on each corner of  Belgrave Square, London, England.  A magnolia stucco building with four main storeys, it is most famed for its interiors (the first floor, or piano nobile, being decorated in Beaux-Arts style).


== Early history ==
Dating from 1842, Sefton House was designed by Philip Hardwick to meet the requirements of the 3rd Earl of Sefton. The town house, with its railings and gate piers, is listed Grade II* for architectural merit. The 3rd and 4th Earls of Sefton enjoyed using it as their London town house; the 5th earl, being an invalid, could not do so and after he died childless in 1901, its lease was sold to William Tebb.
Lord Howard de Walden, also Baron Seaford, acquired the lease of the house in 1902 renaming it Seaford House and installed friezes, panelling, and a staircase of green onyx specially imported from South America.
