The Smith & Wesson M&P15-22 is a .22 long rifle variant of the Smith & Wesson M&P15 semi-automatic rifle, but is blowback-operated rather than direct impingement-operated.  It is intended for recreational shooting ("plinking") and small game hunting.  It is made with a polymer upper and lower receiver rather than the aluminum alloy that is normally used in AR-15 style rifles, and uses proprietary polymer box magazines.

The M&P15-22 was designed to be a less expensive alternative for training with an AR-15 style rifle, as the rifle itself is much less expensive than most AR-15s, and the .22 LR ammunition is often much less expensive than the .223 Remington/5.56Ã—45mm NATO.  The rifle features a safety and bolt lock that operate just like an AR-15's.
The M&P15-22's lower recoil is used as a way to ease new shooters into the sport, allowing them to familiarize themselves with AR-15 controls without the fear of excessive recoil or noise. The disassembly process is very similar to the AR-15 and S&W M&P 15. The lower receiver detaches from the upper with two captured pins. The lower receiver contains a standard M&P15 trigger assembly that is compatible with most AR-15 trigger...
