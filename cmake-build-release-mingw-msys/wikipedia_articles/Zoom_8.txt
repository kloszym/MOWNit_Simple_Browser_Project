The Zoom8 is a youth racing dinghy that sailed in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Austria, the Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia and Russia. It is designed by the Finn Henrik Segercrantz. The Zoom8 is considered an excellent transition dinghy from the Optimist and the more physically demanding dinghies such as the Laser, Europe and 29er, and although many attempts have been made by other classes to fill this gap, the Zoom8 dinghy is one of the few to have succeeded. 

The Swedish Zoom8 Association note that the Zoom 8 is a calm, safe boat and simple enough that beginners can sail it.
The Zoom8 has been spread all over Sweden since 1995 followed a few years later by Denmark and these two countries have won numerous medals in the European and World Championships.
