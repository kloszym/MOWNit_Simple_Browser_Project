John Sebastian Live is a recording of a July 1970 concert performance by American singer/songwriter John Sebastian, released in September of that year by MGM Records.
The album is noteworthy as it was only available for sale for about two months in 1970, making it a relative rarity in Sebastian's catalog.  MGM, for whom Sebastian had recorded (via a distribution arrangement with Kama Sutra Records) as a member of the Lovin' Spoonful during 1965-68, released the album after Sebastian had left MGM/Kama Sutra to sign with Warner Bros. Records' Reprise Records subsidiary as a solo artist.  Contending that Sebastian still owed them an album according to the terms of his Lovin' Spoonful contract, MGM released both Sebastian's debut solo album John B. Sebastian and John Sebastian Live during 1970 without authorization from Sebastian or his management.  Warner Bros. Records sued MGM for copyright infringement following MGM's release of John B. Sebastian (which Warner/Reprise had already issued in January 1970), ultimately resulting in MGM's pulling their releases of the two Sebastian albums from the market.  John Sebastian Live has not been reissued by any record label since it was withdrawn...
