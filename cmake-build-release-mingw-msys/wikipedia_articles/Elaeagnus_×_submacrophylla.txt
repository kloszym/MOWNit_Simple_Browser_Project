Elaeagnus × submacrophylla, formerly known as Elaeagnus × ebbingei, is a hybrid between Elaeagnus macrophylla and Elaeagnus pungens. Several cultivars, including 'Gilt Edge', are grown in gardens as ornamental plants. Both the hybrid and 'Gilt Edge' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.


== Description ==
Elaeagnus × submacrophylla is an evergreen shrub, ultimately growing to about 4 m (13 ft). The upper surfaces of the leaves are dark green, sometimes appearing metallic; the lower surfaces are silvery and scaly. Small fragrant tubular white flowers appear in autumn.


== Taxonomy ==
The hybrid was first discovered in 1929 by Simon Doorenbos, a Dutch horticulturalist, while he was director of the Parks Department in The Hague. He sowed seed from several Elaeagnus species growing next to one another. These included E. macrophylla and E. pungens. Doorenbos gave the hybrid the epithet ebbingei, honouring J.W.E. Ebbinge, and the name E. × ebbingei was widely used until it was realized that the name with priority was E. × submacrophylla, published by Camille Servettaz in 1909. E. × ebbingei is now regarded as an illegitimate name.
