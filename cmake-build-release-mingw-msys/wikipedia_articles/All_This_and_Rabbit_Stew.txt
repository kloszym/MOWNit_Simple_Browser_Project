All This and Rabbit Stew is a 1941 Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Tex Avery. The cartoon was released on September 13, 1941, and features Bugs Bunny.
Because of the cartoon's racial stereotypes of African-Americans, United Artists decided to withhold it from television syndication in the United States beginning in 1968. As such, the short was placed into the so-called Censored Eleven, a group of eleven Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes shorts withheld from U.S. television distribution. It was one of 12 cartoons to be pulled from Cartoon Network's 2001 "June Bugs" marathon by order of AOL Time Warner, on grounds of the subject material's offensiveness. Mel Blanc and Darrell Payne were not credited for their voice work.
The cartoon entered the public domain in 1969, as United Artists, the distributor of the cartoon, chose not to renew the copyright in time.
