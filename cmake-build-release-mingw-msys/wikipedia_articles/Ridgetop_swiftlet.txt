The ridgetop swiftlet  (Collocalia isonota) is a small bird in the swift family Apodidae. It is endemic to the Philippines where it is found on Luzon, Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago.
Its natural habitat is tropical moist lowland forests. It was previously considered a subspecies of the glossy swiftlet.


== Description ==
The ridgetop swiftlet is 9–10 cm (3.5–3.9 in) in length with a square tail. The back and upper surface of the wings are a dark dull blue with a moderate green gloss. The rump is sometimes slightly paler due to the white margins of feathers forming the uppertail coverts. The throat and upper breast are dark grey with fine white scalloping merging into larger greyish chevrons over the lower breast and flanks, becoming white over the belly. There is sometimes a tuft of small feathers on the hallux, the rear facing toe. This species lacks the white spots on the inner webs of the tail feathers that are present in some Collocalia species.
