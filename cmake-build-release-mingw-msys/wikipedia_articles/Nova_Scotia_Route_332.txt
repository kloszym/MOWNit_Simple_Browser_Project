The Riverport & District Community Development Committee submitted a recommended name to the Lunenburg Active Transportation Plan to the Municipality of the District of Lunenburg (MODL). It was to recognize the important role played by Riverport on the LaHave River over the past two hundred and fifty years.  Most major infrastructure in the area, e.g., the fire department; school, post office, electric utility, fish plant and churches. Highway 332, has traditionally been known to local residences as the Riverport Road. This goes back as far as the 1870s with the creation of the Ritcey Cove Circuit which was renamed to the Riverport District.
