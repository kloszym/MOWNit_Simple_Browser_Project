== Culture ==
Like most other villages in Malappuram district, ammappoyil village is also a  predominantly Muslim populated area.  But the population of Hindus and Christian's contribute more than 60%.   So the culture of the locality is mostly secular in which all religions contribute. All the celebrations of three religions bear testimony to this and iftar parties during Ramzan, Sadya during Onam and Christmas  are common. 
Traditionally, Congress MLAs represent the area in Legislative assembly. Kalikavu panchayath is ruled by both LDF and UDF  alternatively which is another testimony of the secular credentials of the area.
Amapoyil is a harmonious area withno history of communal or political clashes. Endowed with lush green natural beauty, the area embodies a peaceful living synergistic with the soul of nature.
