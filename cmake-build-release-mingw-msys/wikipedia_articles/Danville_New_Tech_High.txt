New Tech classes are different from other classes because they utilize project based learning. Students work in groups to solve authentic problems that require standards based content knowledge.
New Tech activity day was on the first day of school where every New Tech student had games to play and obstacles to go through in a group. The goal was to give students a glimpse of what they would be experiencing throughout the year.
