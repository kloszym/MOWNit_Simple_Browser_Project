A hangaroc (sometimes spelled hangerock or hangerok) was an apron-like outer garment worn by women of Norse origins and some other northern European cultures in the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries.  In its usual form the hangaroc comprised a woollen or linen tailored tube wrapped around the body under the armpits and suspended by a pair of cloth straps that ran over the shoulders, secured by brooches. It hung down to mid-calf. The garment was shaped somewhat like a pinafore, and would usually be worn over a tunic-dress called a særk or a kirtle (underdress).
Hangarocs were usually secured by a pair of oval brooches, called "tortoise brooches", which are diagnostic of women's graves from the period.  Wealthier women would wear their hangaroc decorated with braided wool or embroidery.


== Etymology ==
The word originates from German or Germanic Hängerock. Rock means skirt or (historically) dress in German, while hänger refers to the hanging of items from the brooches.
