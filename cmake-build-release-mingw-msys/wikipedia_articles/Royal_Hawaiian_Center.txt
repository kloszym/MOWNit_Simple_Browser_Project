== History ==
The shopping center originally opened in 1979 as the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, as part of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel complex with about 100 shops and restaurants and a food court. It was constructed as three separate buildings adjacent to each other with sky walks connecting the upper floors.  The center, owned by Kamehameha Schools at the time, completed a $100 million renovation in 2007 to include more retailers and restaurants.  The center was sold to RHC Property Holding LLC in 2013.
The Apple Store at the Royal Hawaiian Center was permanently closed on January 20, 2024.
