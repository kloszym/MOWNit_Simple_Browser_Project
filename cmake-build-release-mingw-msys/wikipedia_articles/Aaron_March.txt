March nicknamed himself as The Painter because of his love and passion on art and creativity; thus he relates it to his respective sport, "When I ride, I ride with imagination. Life can be rational but in the snow I can create and enjoy a new world. I love the pop art of US artist Andy Warhol, its genius and recklessness. He was an innovative artist who has broken the mould, as we have done with winter sports." Being a military soldier with the rank of a corporal, March also trains at Centro Sportivo Esercito under his personal coach and mentor Erich Pramsohler.
March made his official debut as part of the Italian squad at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, where he finished fifteenth in the men's giant slalom, losing out to Austria's Benjamin Karl in a first knockout round by 2.27 seconds.
