Sokora Refugees was an amerimanga webcomic by Segamu and Melissa DeJesus started on 31 December 2004 as an ongoing webcomic, updated every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. It has not appeared since 10 November 2006. All comic strips on its website were available free along with some fanservice contents to amuse and excite readers.
This webcomic is also published as a trade paperback by Tokyopop. According to Nielsen BookScan, Sokora Refugees is one of the publisher's best-selling amerimanga. The relevancy of this sales success was called into question in March 2005 in the comics newsblog The Beat, due to a perceived conflict-of-interest involving the author. In its 21 March 2005 issue, Publishers Weekly identified the writer of Sokora Refugees as Kurt Hassler, who was the Borders buyer for graphic novels; "Segamu" is presumably Hassler's pseudonym. Hassler left this position in November 2006.
The website for this webcomic was offline from 13 January 2007 to 29 March 2007, then back online with no new content. It went back offline on 18 April 2007 and, since 2 March 2009 the domain name redirects to a cybersquatter.
