Amaea hedleyi is a species of predatory sea snails, marine prosobranch gastropod mollusks in the family Epitoniidae. 


== Description ==
The length of the shell attains 10 mm, its diameter 3 mm

The protoconch is partially broken in the holotype but preserved in the juvenile specimen, showing 3 smooth whorls with an obtuse apex. The 9 1/2 subsequent whorls are convex and show very slightly oblique, tightly spaced, thin, sharp, and slightly raised longitudinal ribs that are not auriculate. These ribs bend rather sharply near the suture, connecting with the lower ends of the ribs from the previous whorl. Between these ribs, one observes rather thick transverse cords that do not extend over the ribs. These cords are slightly raised and separated by nearly equal spaces. The body  whorl has 23 ribs, two of which, near the outer lip, especially one, transform into fairly thick varices. The base is barely convex, circumscribed by...
