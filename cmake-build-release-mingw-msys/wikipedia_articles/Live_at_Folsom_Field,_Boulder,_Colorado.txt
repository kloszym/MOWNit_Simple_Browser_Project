Live at Folsom Field, Boulder, Colorado is the fourth live album released by the Dave Matthews Band.  It was recorded in Boulder, Colorado at Folsom Field, the football stadium of the University of Colorado Boulder on July 11, 2001. It was released on the RCA Records music label on November 5, 2002 on Compact Disc, VHS, and DVD. The DVD was directed by Fenton Williams of Filament Productions. In promotional material prior to the release, the album was originally titled Open up the Curtains, a reference to the song "I Did It."
The concert went 15 minutes past the allotted 10:30 p.m. curfew time for the venue, and Dave Matthews Band were fined $1,000 for every minute they performed past the curfew, for a total of $15,000. Concerts were suspended at Folsom Field indefinitely following the show, and no concerts were performed at the stadium until two Dead & Company shows in 2016.
