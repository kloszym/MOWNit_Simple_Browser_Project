This table lists those stars/objects which have Flamsteed designations by the constellation in which those stars/objects lie. The name given is that of the article if it does not reflect the Flamsteed designation.  Some articles are linked twice, in cases where the star has been assigned two different Flamsteed designations, usually as noted in different constellations.
