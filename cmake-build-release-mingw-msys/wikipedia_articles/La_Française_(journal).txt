La Française, subtitled Journal de progrès féminin, was a French language reformist feminist weekly newspaper published in France. It was founded in 1906 by feminist Jane Misme, who ran it until 1926, when Cécile Brunschvicg, the future under-secretary of state under the Popular Front, took over. The title was published until 1940. This weekly gave a national audience to the cause of women's suffrage. It even became the mouthpiece for the French Union for Women's Suffrage, founded by Jeanne Schmahl in 1909.

The paper followed developments in women's legislation in specialized sections such as "Le Féminisme au Parlement" and "Les Lois d'intérêt féminin au Parlement". From 1906 to 1913, Germaine Dulac also wrote "mainly portraits of women and theater reviews". Marianne Rauze was responsible for the "work" section during the same period. Jeanne Oddo-Deflou, Pauline Rebour, and Blanche Vogt were contributors, Alice Kaub-Casalonga created posters for the periodical.
