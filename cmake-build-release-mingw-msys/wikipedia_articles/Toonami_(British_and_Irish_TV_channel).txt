== History ==


=== As CNX ===

Toonami was a programming block on Cartoon Network, until June 2002 when its programming was moved to the soon-to-be launched CNX.
On 24 September 2002, Turner Broadcasting System Europe announced its launch on 14 October. CNX would be the first Cartoon Network derivative to launch outside North America.
To promote CNX, six people attempted to break the world record for continuous TV watching, set at 46 hours, 30 minutes, and 50.91 seconds. Three participants—Steven Hayes, Adam King, and Nick Tungett—succeeded, watching for 47 hours. They earned a place in the 2002 Guinness World Records, a £5,000 cash prize, and £2,000 in audio-visual equipment.
The channel was initially available on Sky Digital and NTL:home. At the time, Turner was in negotiations with Telewest to add the channel to their Active Digital cable service, and was soon added on 15 January 2003.
In April 2003, Turner Broadcasting System had considered launching a U.S version of CNX, but Mark Lazarus, the former head of Turner Entertainment, stated such a launch was "not imminent", and never materialised.
