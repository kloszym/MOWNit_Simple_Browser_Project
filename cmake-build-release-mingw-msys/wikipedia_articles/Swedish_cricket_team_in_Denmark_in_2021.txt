The Sweden cricket team toured Denmark to play a three-match Twenty20 International (T20I) series at the Svanholm Park in Brøndby. The series formed part of Denmark's preparation for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Europe Qualifier, together with a tour of the Netherlands later in August to face Netherlands A. This series was the first international action with the Sweden national team for their coach, former South African international cricketer Jonty Rhodes. Denmark won the series 2–1. Sweden followed the series with another in Finland.
