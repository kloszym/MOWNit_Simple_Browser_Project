North Carolina State Fair station is a seasonal Amtrak station serving the North Carolina State Fairground in Raleigh, North Carolina. It is served by Amtrak's Carolinian and Piedmont trains when the fair is in operation in mid-October.
The station waiting area is normally a tent on the west corner of Blue Ridge Road and south corner of Hillsborough Street. There are no ticketing services on site. A wheelchair lift stored near the grade crossing provides accessibility to passengers.
In 2023 and 2024, the station was relocated west due to road construction.
Across the tracks from the fairgrounds is an abandoned freight spur leading to what is today a North Carolina Department of Transportation equipment storage facility along Beryl Road, as well as another one leading to what is now a storage warehouse. Sidetracks exist on both sides of the tracks between Powell Drive and Blue Ridge Road.
