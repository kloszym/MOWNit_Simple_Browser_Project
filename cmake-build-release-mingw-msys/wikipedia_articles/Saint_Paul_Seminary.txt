The Saint Paul Seminary (SPS) is a Catholic major seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota.  A part of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, SPS prepares men to enter the priesthood and permanent diaconate, and educates lay men and women on Catholic theology.
SPS sits adjacent to the south campus of the University of St. Thomas. Since its creation in 1894, over 3,000 seminarians from SPS have been ordained priests.
