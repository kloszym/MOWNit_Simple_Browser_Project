The 2010 Gaelic Football Championship is the 2010 season of the tournament, which includes European teams other than those from Ireland and Britain. The Championship follows two phases. During the first part of the year teams compete within their own regions in a series of four to five tournaments to determine the regional champions and runners-up. During the second part of the year the champion and runner-up of each region compete in a series of three pan-European tournaments to determine the European Champion. All teams who did not reach the top two spots of their regional championship compete in a second-tier championship called the Shield. In each tournament teams gain points depending on their respective performances (winner gains 25 points, runner-up 20 points, etc.).
The matches are played 11 a side and 10 to 15 minutes a half (depending on the number of matches to be played on the day).


== Regional Phase ==
During the Regional Phase, only the points gained in each team's best three tournaments count.
