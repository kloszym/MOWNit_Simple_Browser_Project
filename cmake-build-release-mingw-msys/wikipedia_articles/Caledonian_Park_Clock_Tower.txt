The Caledonian Park Clock Tower is located in Holloway and is the major remaining element of the Metropolitan Cattle Market, opened in 1855 by the City of London Corporation as a replacement for the market at Smithfield. The complex was designed by the Corporation's Surveyor, James Bunstone Bunning, and was laid out on a site of 30 acres (0.12 km2) that originally formed the estate of a mansion, Copenhagen House. The market consisted of the central clock tower, enclosures for animals, slaughterhouses, sales arenas, administrative offices and four public houses, one standing at each corner of the complex. The cattle market was closed in the 1930s, and the meat market in the 1960s, with much of the site being redeveloped for council housing. The clock tower, two stretches of railings and three of the four pubs are all that now remain. After suffering neglect and vandalism in the late 20th century, the clock tower was restored between 2016 and 2019 and is now open to the public. It is a Grade II* listed building, the railings and pubs having separate Grade II listings.
