The Livoberezhna Line is the second line of the Kyiv Light Rail, located in the eastern part of Kyiv. Opened in 2000, the light rail corridor underwent several renovations in 2010 and reopened in 2012 for regular service. The Livoberezhna Line connects the Troieshchyna urban rail station with Vygurivshchyna and central Troieshchyna. The 4 and 5 trams both run along the Livoberezhna Line.
At one point, the Kyiv City Administration proposed extending the Kyiv Metro system to Troieschyna by creating the Livoberezhna Line, although this proposal was scrapped in 2014 in favor of keeping the light rail system.
