Robert Kutner (11 April 1867, Ückermünde – 5 October 1913, Berlin) was a German urologist.
He studied medicine at the universities of Berlin, Kiel and Freiburg and furthered his education in Vienna and Paris. While a student, his influences were Maximilian Nitze in Berlin, Leopold Ritter von Dittel in Vienna and Jean Casimir Félix Guyon in Paris. In 1891, he received his medical doctorate, and shortly afterwards, he settled in Berlin as a specialist of urinary diseases. In 1902, he obtained the title of professor. Kutner was among the first to use photography to acquire a visual record of internal body cavities.
Along with Ernst von Bergmann, he is regarded as one of the founders of the medical training system in Germany. He was devoted to the development of medical postgraduate education in Germany, and in 1906 was named director of the Kaiserin Friedrich-Haus for medical postgraduate study. In 1904, with Bergmann and hygienist Martin Kirchner, he founded the publication Zeitschrift für ärztliche Fortbildung ("Journal of Medical Education").
