The Global Mobile Artillery Rocket System (GMARS, ) is a wheeled multiple rocket launcher built and designed by Rheinmetall and Lockheed Martin, with them first partnering up in 2023. It is claimed to be capable of providing fire support at a range of up to 400 km (250 mi). It is similar to the M270 multiple launch rocket system and has a two-pod launcher that can fire the MLRS Family of Munitions, including the MGM-140 ATACMS and Precision Strike Missile. It was first shown at Eurosatory 2024 using the chassis of the HX 8x8 tactical truck as a base.
The GMARS is currently competing against the Euro-PULS to fully replace the German Army's MARS II systems.
It is said by Rheinmetall and Lockheed Martin that the GMARS will be able to use the GMLRS, ER GMRLS, ATACMS, and Precision Strike Missile missiles. There are currently plans to integrate Surface-Launch Cruise Missiles and 122 mm rocket pods in the future.
