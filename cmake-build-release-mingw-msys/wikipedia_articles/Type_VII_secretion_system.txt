Type VII secretion systems are bacterial secretion systems first observed in the phyla Actinomycetota and Bacillota. Bacteria use such systems to transport, or secrete, proteins into the environment. The bacterial genus Mycobacterium uses type VII secretion systems (T7SS) to secrete proteins across their cell envelope. The first T7SS system discovered was the ESX-1 System.
T7SS has been studied as a virulence factor associated with the ESX-1 system in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These secretion systems are often found in gram-positive bacteria. Type VII secretion systems are necessary in Mycobacterium because of their impermeable membrane. The RD1 locus or Gene for Type VII secretion can create a lytic effect through ESX-1 transport.

Cryogenic electron microscopy was used to determine that a complex of two identical subunits made from four proteins forms the structure of the type VII secretion system in Mycobacterium smegmatis. T7SS forms a six-sided complex that allows for nearly 165 membrane attachments. This shows how complex the secretion system is. The MDa complex of the Type VII secretion system is found embedded in the inner membrane.
