Hindu Colony is an old locality situated in the Dadar area of Mumbai, India. The locality falls in between Dadar and Matunga on the east side of the Central Railway Line. Traditionally, the area had been a locality of Maharashtrians, Catholics, Jews and Gujaratis, though Maharashtrians are the highest by numbers.
The Buildings were designed in a style which was prevalent in the pre independence era. British styled Buildings with service staircases and glimpses of Victorian architecture can still be seen. Redevelopment has lent a new look to most of the colony. 

The Colony extends from the Dadar TT Circle,  more specifically from the Eastern End of the Tilak Bridge ( which connects Dadar East and West)  to Ruia College. The Colony is typically designed with roads being identified as Lanes,  totalling to 6.
The Dadar T.T. Circle is a traffic convergence area,  and an important junction as well as a landmark.
The term T.T. Originates from the tram terminus which was located here,  in the British Era
