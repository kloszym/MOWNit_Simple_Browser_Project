== Life ==

A student of French literature from Fukuoka University, Kobayashi published his first manga, Tōdai Itchokusen, in 1976 in Weekly Shōnen Jump while still in school. Another of his early series, Obocchama-kun, a satire about a naughty rich boy in the heyday of Japan's bubble economy, won the 1989 Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga.
Kobayashi was included on Aum Shinrikyo's assassination list after he began satirising the cult. An assassination attempt was made on him by the members of the cult in 1993.
Kobayashi is a denier of both the Nanjing Massacre and of the comfort women system during World War II.
