The UK Singles Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling singles of the week in the United Kingdom. Before 2004, the chart was only based on the sales of physical singles.

The entry date is when the single appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced).
One-hundred and forty-two singles were in the top ten in 1990. Eight singles from 1989 remained in the top 10 for several weeks at the beginning of the year, while "Pray by MC Hammer, "Sadeness (Part I)" by Enigma and "The Grease Megamix" by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John" were all released in 1990 but did not reach their peak until 1991. Thirty artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 1990. Adamski, Happy Mondays, MC Hammer, Mariah Carey and Snap! were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 single in 1990.
