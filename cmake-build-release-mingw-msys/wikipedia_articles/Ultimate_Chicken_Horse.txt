== Gameplay ==

Ultimate Chicken Horse is a platform video game where players assume the role of one of various animals. The goal of each game is to score points by building a platform level one piece at a time (per player) and race each other to a flag on the other side of the level. Players add obstacles designed to challenge their opponents, while also making sure they themselves can handle their handiwork. If nobody reaches the goal, or if everybody does, nobody gets any points. Points are awarded each round for various achievements, such as reaching the goal first, or setting a successful trap. The winner of the match is the player who reaches a set number of points or has the most points after a set number of rounds. Each round is estimated to last a minute.
