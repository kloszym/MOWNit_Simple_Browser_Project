== Overview ==
Sykes, who hails from Brooklyn, is nicknamed "The Bull", due to his first name. Specifically, he hails from the Rutland Rd./the 90'z section of Brooklyn. He lost his 13th fight to unbeaten Owen Beck but that remained his only blemish on his record for a while in that he beat the likes of Israel Garcia (record 10-0), Charles Hatcher (15-2), Talmadge Griffis (21-1-3) and Sherman Williams to climb up the ladder. He drew with former Cruiser title holder Imamu Mayfield then beat Jovo Pudar (21-1) and even fringe contender Friday Ahunanya (20-2-1) in 2005. His only problem was his lack of power as only 7 of his first 25 wins have come the short route.
Undefeated KO artist Samuel Peter was the first to knock him out but lightly regarded southpaw Derek Bryant (18-4-1) also scored a TKO effectively ending any hopes of becoming a contender.
Former two-time heavyweight champ Hasim Rahman beat him in a 10-round decision.  He was knocked out by IBF #1 contender Alexander Povetkin...
