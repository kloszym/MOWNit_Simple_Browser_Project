OD600 (Also written as O.D. 600, D600, o.d. 600, OD600) is an abbreviation indicating the optical density of a sample measured at a wavelength of 600 nm in 1 cm light path (unless otherwise stated). It is a commonly used in microbiology for estimating the concentration of bacteria or other cells in a liquid as the 600 nm wavelength does little to damage or hinder their growth. OD600 is a type of turbidity measurement. Since optical density in case of OD600 measurements results from light scattering by particles (cells) rather than absorption, size and shape as well as dead cells and debris of a cell may add to light dissipating. Distinctive cell types that are at densities of the same level (eg. cell/mL), may, therefore, show varying values OD600, when estimated on a similar instrument.  
For turbid samples such as cell cultures, the major contributor for the optical density measured is light scattering and not the result of molecular absorption following the Beer-Lambert Law. The measurements are therefore depending on the optical setup of the spectrophotometer (distance between the cell holder and instrument exit slit, monochromator optics, slit geometry, etc.), different instrument...
