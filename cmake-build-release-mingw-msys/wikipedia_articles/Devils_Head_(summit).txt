Devils Head is topped by the Devil's Head Lookout, an active United States Forest Service fire lookout tower.  Access to the summit and lookout tower is via the Devils Head National Recreation Trail.
Devils Head name comes from prospectors of the late 1800s.  From the southwest of Devils Head, and looking northeast toward the mountain, one can see a shape of a face laying flat, as if the mountain was looking up. Some of the forest has softened the looks, as there used to be a more obvious eye socket, and facial features.  However, from this angle, one is still able to see the face and even horns.
