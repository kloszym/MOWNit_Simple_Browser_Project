In enzymology, a phosphoribosyl-ATP diphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.31) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-ATP + H2O 
  
    
      
        ⇌
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }
  
 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-AMP + diphosphate
Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-ATP and H2O, whereas its two products are 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-AMP and diphosphate.
This enzyme participates in histidine metabolism.  It employs one cofactor, H+.


== Nomenclature ==
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-ATP diphosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphatase, and phosphoribosyladenosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase.
