DeAtley Island is a large, ice-covered island lying 19 kilometres (12 mi) east of Spaatz Island at the south side of the Ronne Entrance. The island was sighted and roughly mapped by air during the RARE (1947â€“48). Finn Ronne later named the island after Colonel Ellsworth DeAtley, United States Army, and his wife Thelma DeAtley, who both contributed clothing and food in support of RARE.
