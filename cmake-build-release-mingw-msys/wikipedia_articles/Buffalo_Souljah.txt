Buffalo Souljah's career began at the age of eight when he composed his first song, "Zuva Randisinga Kanganwe" (The day I will never forget). The song was inspired by a childhood incident in which he and his brother were chased by some baboons after having taunted and provoked them. Buffalo credits his passion for music to his father, who was also a musician. His father was a jazz artist and saxophonist who worked with Thomas Mapfumo in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Buffalo Souljah also recorded an Afro-jazz album called Indolvu Yangena on VaNyoni Beats Records...
