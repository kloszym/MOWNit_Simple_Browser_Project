Panchali Sabatham (Tamil: பாஞ்சாலி சபதம், lit. 'Panchali's Vow') is a Tamil epic by the poet Subramania Bharati. The poem retells the events of the episode of the game of dice from the Mahabharata. Bharati uses the incidents from the Mahabharata to draw parallels with the Kurukshetra War and the Indian War of Independence and Panchali (Draupadi) with Bharata Mata.
It is popularly known for emphasizing liberation of women from oppression and remains as one of the well known feminist works in Tamil literature.
