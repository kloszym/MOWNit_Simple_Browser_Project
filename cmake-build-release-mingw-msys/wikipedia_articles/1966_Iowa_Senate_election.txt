The 1966 Iowa State Senate elections took place as part of the biennial 1966 United States elections. Iowa voters elected state senators in 32 of the state senate's 61 districts. At this time, the Iowa Senate still had several multi-member districts. State senators serve four-year terms in the Iowa State Senate.
The Iowa Senate was expanded from 59 to 61 members and new district maps were drawn for the 1966 election. The Iowa General Assembly provides statewide maps of each district.
The primary election on September 6, 1966, determined which candidates appeared on the November 8, 1966 general election ballot.
Following the previous election, Democrats had control of the Iowa state Senate with 34 seats to Republicans' 25 seats.
To claim control of the chamber from Democrats, the Republicans needed to net 6 Senate seats.
Democrats maintained control of the Iowa State Senate following the 1966 general election with the balance of power shifting to Democrats holding 32 seats and Republicans having 29 seats (a net gain of 4 seats for Republicans and net loss of 2 seats for Democrats).
