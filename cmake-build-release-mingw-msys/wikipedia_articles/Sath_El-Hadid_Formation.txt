The Sath El-Hadid Formation, translating to "Iron Surface" in Arabic "سطح الحديد", is a geological formation in Egypt characterized by a nummulitic limestone bank containing large and small Nummulites. Introduced into the stratigraphy of the south Fayum area by Iskander in 1943, this formation is significant in the middle Eocene (Bartonian).


== Stratigraphy and composition ==
The Sath El-Hadid Formation is approximately 25 meters thick and overlays the Midawara Formation. It is prominent in the Wadi El Rayan area, capping many mesas. The base of the formation is marked by a contact between the snow-white Sath El-Hadid limestone and the brown sandy limestone of the Midawara Formation. The upper contact with the El Gharag Formation is indicated by the emergence of brown and light brown shales above the nummulitic limestone.
Distinctive features of the Sath El-Hadid Formation include secondary flint concretions at the top and a gradual transition at the lower contact in the type section (Gebel Sath El-Hadid section). This gradual transition is characterized by the basal marly bryozoan limestone of the Sath El-Hadid and the uppermost glauconitic sandy yellow limestone of the Midawara Formation...
