Sthalasayana Perumal Temple (also called Arulmaakadal Perumal Temple) is a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu located near Kollumangudi, Tamil Nadu, India.  It is located 2 km away from Kollumangudi, 40 km away from Kumbakonam and 10 km from Karaikal. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Alvar saints from the 6th–9th centuries CE. It is one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Sthalasayana Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Thirumagal Nachiyar. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all the shrines. There is a four-tiered rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, in the temple.
Sthalasayana Perumal is believed to have appeared to sage Vyaghrapada. Three daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Brahmotsavam festival, celebrated during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May–June), being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.
