A melting tank is a tank used by manufacturing companies to manufacture a variety of products.


== Melting tank uses ==
Melting tanks can be designed to melt products such as:

Resin
Solder
alloys with a low melting temperature
Paraffin wax
Soy
Vegetable oil
Palm wax
Soap
Gels
Tar
Candle wax
Glue
Babbitt
Paraffin
Synthetic adhesives
Eutectic salts
Oil
Capping compound
Plastics


== Different types of tanks ==
The type of tank used to melt solder and tar is very different from one that is used to melt waxes, especially organic waxes such as soy, for making scented and colored candles. For example, tanks used for adhesives may need to heat up to 500degrees(°) Fahrenheit(F), while an organic soy wax will be ruined at over 140 °F and should never be heated above 200 °F. A delicate soy wax used to make candles would be burned and destroyed if not heated in an even, lower temperature than solder or tar. Also, since soaps and candles are scented and colored, the tanks designed for melting these substances need to be specially polished so there is no cross-contamination between different scents of candles or soaps. Based on this challenge, there are melting tanks that are specially coated for...
