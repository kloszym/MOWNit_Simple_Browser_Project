The Heino murders were a double murder case in Finland on 24 August 2001 when 16-year-old Saku Salo, 17-year-olds Sampsa Mäntylä and Jani Pesola, and 18-year-old-Markus Aarre Walter Österman murdered businessman Martti Heino and his wife Elise Heino in Loppi.


== Murder ==
The Heino couple were enticed to come to a summer cabin in Loppi to discuss business issues, including the sale of 100 mobile phones. When the two arrived they were met by Pesola, who guided them to a location that was within range of Salo, waiting in ambush behind a rock. Martti Heino was killed by the first bullet, which hit him in the neck. Elise Heino made a call to emergency services on her mobile phone, but it was cut off by the second bullet. Salo, Pesola and Mäntylä packed the bodies into large sports bags, placed them in Martti Heino's car, drove the car back to Espoo, and dumped the bags into the sea off the Espoo coast. On the following day the boys broke into the Heino household and stole a number of mobile phones. The bodies were discovered by the police on 4 September 2001 after an extensive search.
The motive for the murder was that Österman had felt Martti Heino had cheated him in a mobile telephone...
