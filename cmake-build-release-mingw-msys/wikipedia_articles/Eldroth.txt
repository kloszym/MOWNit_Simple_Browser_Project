Eldroth is a village in North Yorkshire, England. It is in the civil parish of Lawkland, some 3.25 miles (5.23 km) west of Settle, on a stream which is one of the tributaries of the River Wenning. The main part of Eldroth only consists of twelve buildings, but the presence of the church, marks the settlement out as a village, rather than a hamlet. Eldroth lies just within the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
