The borders of Suriname consist of land borders with three countries: Guyana, Brazil, and France  (via French Guiana). The borders with Guyana and France are in dispute, but the border with Brazil has been uncontroversial since 1906.

In 1860, the question was posed from the French side, which of the two tributary rivers of the Marowijne River (also called Maroni and Marowini) was the headwater, and thus the border. A joint French-Dutch commission was appointed to review the issue. The Dutch side of the commission consisted of J.H. Baron van Heerdt tot Eversberg, J.F.A. Cateau van Rosevelt and August Kappler. Luits Vidal, Ronmy, Boudet and Dr. Rech composed the French side. In 1861 measurements were taken, which produced the following result: the Lawa had a flow rate of 35,960 m3 (47,034 cu. yd.) /minute at a width of 436 metres (477 yards); the Tapanahony had a flow rate of 20,291 m3 (26,540 cu. yd.) /minute at a width of 285  metres (312 yards). Thus, the Lawa River was the headwater of the Maroni River.
There were no problems with this decision until 1885, when the discovery of gold in the area between the Lawa and the Tapanahony created a new border conflict...
