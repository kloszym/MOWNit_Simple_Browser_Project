The 1905 Primera División was the 5th. season of top-flight football in Uruguay.


== Overview ==
The tournament consisted of a round-robin championship. It involved six teams, and the champion was Montevideo Wanderers, being the first time that a club other than CURCC or Nacional won the Primera División.
As a curiosity during this championship, Nacional presented two teams to the competition, their official team and a second team formed by substitutes players, which was called "Nacional B". This was the first and only time in the editions of the Uruguayan Championships that a club participated with two teams.
