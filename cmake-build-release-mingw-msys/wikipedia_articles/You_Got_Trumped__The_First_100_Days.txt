You Got Trumped: The First 100 Days is a short format satirical dark comedy TV and Web series. It was produced during the 2016 presidential election, examining what a hypothetical (at the time) first 100 days in office of President Donald J. Trump might look like. The series stars Ron Sparks as Chris Christie and impressionist John Di Domenico as Trump, with all episodes directed by Derek Harvie. Renaud Le Van Kim et Guillaume Lacroix served as producers on the series, which has been described as "insane" and "comico-dystopian".
The first series produced by French video on demand service Blackpills, co-produced by Miramedia and Together Media, You Got Trumped utilized raunchy humor, with several episodes ultimately age restricted and/or pulled from YouTube following complaints then re-posted in censored versions, including "Trump Juice", in which Trump makes out with his daughter Ivanka and sells his semen on TV, "The Art of the Dull" in which Trump presents China's "Prime Minister" with a self-portrait featuring his exposed "huge American penis", and the trailer.
Blackpills publicized its series both with the tagline "Grabbing America by the Pussy" and a "Make Twitter Great Again"...
