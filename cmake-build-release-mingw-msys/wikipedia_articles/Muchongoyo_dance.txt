Muchongoyo is a presentational dance and drumming style that emphasizes acrobatic and stomping sequences to dazzle spectators during gatherings or competitions with a complementary rythme of sharp claps. In Zimbabwe, it is the most well-liked Ndau dance. In Zimbabwe's Chipinge, Chimanimani, Chiredzi, and Buhera districts, muchongoyo is a traditional dance that is performed for celebratory purposes or events of cultural significance such as burials of chief and royals. It particularly identifies with the Ndau people, though less strongly identifies with the Tsonga (Shangani) people. Muchongolo is the name of it in Tsonga.


== Etymology ==
The word Muchongoyo comes from the Ndau word kuchongoya, which means to stamp one's foot.


== History ==
The purpose of the violent foot stomping in muchongoyo is historically to chastise warriors before battle and to celebrate success afterward. The dance is now practiced to provide entertainment at occasions like traditional weddings, chief installation ceremonies, harvest festivals, keeping fit while dating, or in honor of a deceased dancer. Muchongoyo does not lean toward any particular faith, in contrast to other dances.
