The Oerlikon KCA is a Swiss 30 mm (1.181 in) gas-operated single-barrel revolver cannon developed for aircraft use. Its most noticeable use was on the JA 37 Viggen fighter mounted in a conformal pod as the akan m/75. The KCA fires a 30 mm × 173 mm (1.181 in × 6.811 in) shell that is 50% heavier than the NATO standard ammunition used on ADEN and DEFA cannon. It can fire up to 1350 rounds per minute at a muzzle velocity of 1030 m/s, with an effective range of 2,500 m (8,200 ft)
A modified version of the KCA cannon is still in use as the main armament of the Skyranger 30 short range air defence system.
