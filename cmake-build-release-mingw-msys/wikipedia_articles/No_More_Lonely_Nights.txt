"No More Lonely Nights" is a song written and performed by Paul McCartney, first released on 24 September 1984 on the album Give My Regards to Broad Street.
The song features David Gilmour from Pink Floyd on guitars including the soaring solos and fills throughout the song. Reflecting upon the recording in a radio interview prior to 1990's Knebworth concerts, Gilmour told Jim Ladd that "No More Lonely Nights" was the last thing McCartney recorded for the film Give My Regards to Broad Street (late 1983/early 1984), and that he told McCartney to give his session fee to a charity of his choice.
