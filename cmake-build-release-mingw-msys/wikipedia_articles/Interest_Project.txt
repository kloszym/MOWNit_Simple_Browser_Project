An Interest Project was an earned award for the Cadette and Senior levels of Girl Scouts of the USA. In the Fall of 2011, a new program was introduced and Interest Projects were retired.   
They were earned through completing skill-building activities and certain requirements.  Each Interest Project comes as a patch or badge and each represent an achievement in a different area such as camping or first aid. The badges are sewn onto the bottom left and right sections of the vest and the lower half of the sash uniform parts.
