In mathematics, the diameter of a set of points in a metric space is the largest distance between points in the set. As an important special case, the diameter of a metric space is the largest distance between any two points in the space. This generalizes the diameter of a circle, the largest distance between two points on the circle. This usage of diameter also occurs in medical terminology concerning a lesion or in geology concerning a rock. 
A bounded set is a set whose diameter is finite. Within a bounded set, all distances are at most the diameter.


== Formal definition ==
The diameter of an object is the least upper bound (denoted "sup") of the set of all distances between pairs of points in the object.
