In a review for AllMusic, Michael G. Nastos wrote: "This homage to Tony Williams comes straight from the heart, unfiltered and exploding with the absolute dynamism both drummers have always displayed. What is even better -- this sounds very updated and not so retro as one might assume, a feather in the cap of the always formidable and substantive Cindy Blackman."
Jeff Winbush of All About Jazz stated: "Putting aside preconceived notions of what Tony Williams' Lifetime might sound like in 2010, Blackman's sonic explorations take jazz-rock beyond where the late drummer envisioned it... If Another Lifetime doesn't quite herald the second coming of the jazz-rock movement... it does prove there is quite a bit of vitality left in...
