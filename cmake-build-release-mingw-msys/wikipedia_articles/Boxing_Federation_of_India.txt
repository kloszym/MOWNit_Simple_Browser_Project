Mostly due to the efforts of H.V.Pointon, the President of the Bombay Presidency Amateur Boxing Federation (1944â€“48), Indian Amateur Boxing Federation was founded on February 25, 1949. Major F.G.Baker became the first secretary at the inaugural meeting at the Governor's Pavilion of the Cricket Club of India in Mumbai. Bombay (Mumbai) became the headquarters of the body. The first national championships were held at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai in March 1950.
Indian Boxing Federation was also known as Indian Amateur Boxing Federation (IABF) and was suspended by the International Amateur Boxing Association in 2014, following which BFI was recognised as the recognised body.
