During the 1998â€“99 English football season, Aston Villa competed in the FA Premier League. The season was Villa's eighth in the Premier League, and their eleventh consecutive season in the top division of English football.
This would be manager John Gregory's first full season. The early-season sale of Dwight Yorke to Manchester United seemed to rule out Villa's chances of challenging for a place in Europe, but new signings Dion Dublin and Paul Merson soon revitalised the attack and the team spent much of the first half of the season at the top of the Premier League.
Eventually, the challenge from Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea proved to be too strong, and Villa's season capitulated. The team finally finished sixth below West Ham United, thus missed out on a European place.
