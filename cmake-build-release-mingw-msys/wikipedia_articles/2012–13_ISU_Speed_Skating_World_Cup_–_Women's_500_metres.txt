The 500 meters distance for women in the 2012–13 ISU Speed Skating World Cup was contested over 12 races on six occasions, out of a total of nine World Cup occasions for the season, with the first occasion taking place in Heerenveen, Netherlands, on 16–18 November 2012, and the final occasion also taking place in Heerenveen on 8–10 March 2013.
A standout moment was South Korean skater Lee Sang-hwa breaking her own world record twice during the season. On January 19, 2013, at the World Cup event in Calgary, she set a new world record with a time of 36.99 seconds. The following day, January 20, she surpassed this achievement by recording a time of 36.80 seconds, further lowering the world record.
Lee Sang-hwa went on to win the cup, while Jenny Wolf of Germany came second, and Wang Beixing of China came third. The defending champion, Yu Jing of China, ended up in 10th place.
