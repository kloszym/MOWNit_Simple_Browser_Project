Zebra chip, also known as papa manchada and papa rayada, is a disease in potatoes putatively caused by an alphaproteobacterium "Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum", which is vectored by the potato psyllid.

Additionally, striped sections of chips frequently burn and caramelize, resulting in a bitter flavor.  No health risks have been connected with consumption of infected potato chips.
