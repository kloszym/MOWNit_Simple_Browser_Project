== Composer notes ==
A note from the composer: My head was full of psalms while I was writing this work. I feel excited, sometimes agonized because of psalmist words, but I cannot say that at any time I was aware of any direct correspondence between a musical image and a particular poetic image. Yes, despite this, I quoted two verses from Psalms Book, one on the first page of the score and the other one on the last, not to relate them specifically with the musical context, but to indicate them. Symbolically an imaginative clima and, above all, to testify the natural involvement that made me write this work. First citation comes from Psalm 22, vers 12: "... Cashan's strong bulls messed me up;" the second one from Psalm 88, vers 12: "will your wonders be known in the dark?"
