The Sling TSi is a South African four-seat, single-engine, low-wing homebuilt aircraft sold in kit form by Sling Aircraft of Johannesburg South. It was developed from the Sling 4.
The Sling TSi first flew in 2018, with kits being shipped to builders in fall 2018.


== Design and development ==
The aircraft was developed in 2018. The Sling TSi is an all-metal, low-wing, fixed tricycle gear homebuilt aircraft. The airplane is equipped with the new Rotax 915iS engine and was the inspiration for the designation of TSi. Parts of the wings and fuselage were reinforced and outfitted with flush riveting for increased strength and reduced drag over the Sling 4.
The UK Light Aircraft Association has limited the airframe safe life to 1600 hours due to a stress point in the wing design.  Additionally, the LAA has deemed the flight characteristics unsuitable for flight in IMC.


== Operational history ==
The first Sling TSi in the USA was shown at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh in 2018.
