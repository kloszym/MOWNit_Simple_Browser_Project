== History ==
St Paul's was built in 1839–40 and designed by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe. The church cost £1,700 (equivalent to £190,000 in 2023) to build and £500 of this was met by a grant from the Church Building Commission. The church was consecrated on 27 June 1849 by Rt Revd John Bird Sumner who was at that time the Bishop of Chester. When first built it had seating for 479 people. In 1909 it was enlarged by adding an extra bay to the nave and increasing the size of the chancel, the architect being J. A. Seward of Preston. The addition had resulted in a higher roof for the chancel, and in 1966 the nave roof was raised to the same level as the chancel.
