Metrical poetry in Sanskrit is called Chandas (Sanskrit: छन्दस्) or Chandas/Chandassu (Kannada: ಛಂದಸ್ಸು) and Chandassu (Telugu: ఛందస్సు). The term Chandas (Sanskrit: छन्दः/छन्दस्, romanized: chandaḥ/chandas (singular), Sanskrit: छन्दांसि, romanized: chandāṃsi (plural)) means "pleasing, alluring, lovely, delightful, or charming", and is based on the root chad, which means "esteemed to please, to seem good, feel pleasant, and/or something that nourishes, gratifies, or is celebrated". Chandas refers to the Vedas themselves. Krishna refers to the Vedas as leaves of the tree of creation. Vedas being in verse-form (Chandas), also came to be known as Chandas. The term also refers to "any metrical part of the Vedas or other composition". Prose and poetry follows the rules of Chandas to design the structural features of 'poetry'. Chhandas is a definable aspect of many definable and indefinable aspects of poetry. Chhandas generates rhythm to the literature when the rules are properly followed. Rhythm is important to literature as a preliminary attraction.
