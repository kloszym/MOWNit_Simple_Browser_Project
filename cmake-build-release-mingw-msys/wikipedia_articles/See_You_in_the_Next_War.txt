See You in the Next War (Serbian: Довиђења у следећем рату, transliterated: Doviđenja u sledećem ratu, Slovene: Nasvidenje v naslednji vojni) is a 1980 Yugoslav war film directed by Živojin Pavlović. It competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival.
The film's screenplay is based on the Vitomil Zupan's novel Menuet za kitaro (A Menuet for Guitar), published in 1975. Like the novel, the film takes place partially in Nazi-occupied Slovenia during World War II, and partially in Spain, where the main character, a former partisan, meets his former German adversary in a summer resort.
