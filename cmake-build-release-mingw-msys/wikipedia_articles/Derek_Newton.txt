Derek Newton (born November 16, 1987) is an American former professional football offensive tackle. He was selected by the Houston Texans in the seventh round of the 2011 NFL draft and played for the team until knee injuries halted his career in 2016. He also played for the New Orleans Saints. He played college football at Arkansas State, and Hinds Community College before that.


== Early life ==
A native of Utica, Mississippi, Newton attended Hinds County Agricultural High School, where he was an All-Metro and All-District lineman as a senior, after playing only two years of high school football. He helped the team to a 10–0 regular-season record during senior season. However, Newton went unregarded by national recruiting services like Rivals.com and Scout.com. Despite drawing some interest from North Texas and Troy, he decided to attend Hinds Community College in Raymond, Mississippi (2006–2007).


== College career ==
A two-star recruit coming out of junior college, Newton went on to Arkansas State, where he redshirted in 2008. He became a starter in 2009, earning Second-team All-Sun Belt Conference honors. In 2010, he earned First-team honors.
