Race City Motorsport Park, also known as Race City, was a multi-track auto racing facility located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  The facility featured a ¼ mile dragstrip, a 3.2 km (2.0 mi) 11-turn road course, and a ½ mile paved short oval.
The Race City grounds, known as Race City Speedway, was a regular host of Warped Tour.
Race City was due to close around October 9, 2009. However, on September 28, 2009, Calgary city council voted in favour of extending the lease on Race City until 2015. This decision was later overturned, and the track officially closed on October 21, 2011 due to expansion of the Shepard landfill.
