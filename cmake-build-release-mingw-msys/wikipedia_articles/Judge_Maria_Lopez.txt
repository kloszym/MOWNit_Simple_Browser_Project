Judge Maria Lopez debuted in the same week as another syndicated courtroom show featuring a Latina judge, Cristina's Court.  In January 2007, SPT renewed the series for a second season despite being the lowest rated court show of the 2006â€“07 season, averaging a 0.9 rating. However, in February 2008 reports indicated that due to two seasons of low ratings, Sony Pictures Television was cancelling the series and the show ended on May 23, 2008, along with Judge Hatchett.
