Show of Hands is the debut album by English folk duo Show of Hands. The duo formed when Phil Beer took a break from folk rock band The Albion Band, requesting to Steve Knightley that they record a cassette together in Knightley's garage. Knightley, who had recently returned to the duo's native Devon after departing London, agreed, and the duo recorded the album together in January 1987 in Catsley Home, described by Knightley as an outbuilding in the remotest part of Dorset. The album contains twelve compositions, mostly songs by Knightley.
The duo self-released the album in early 1987 on cassette only. It was recorded and released to coincide with their first tour, and was only sold from the duo's concerts. The duo halted their time together as Beer returned The Albion Band, but returned in 1990 with Tall Ships, an album centered on its title track which is a twenty-two-minute adaption of the much shorter song that opens Show of Hands. Both albums, along with Out for the Count (1991), were out of print by 1995, so the duo released the compilation Backlog 1987â€“1991 (1995) to compile highlights from the three albums. Six songs from Show of Hands feature on the compilation.
