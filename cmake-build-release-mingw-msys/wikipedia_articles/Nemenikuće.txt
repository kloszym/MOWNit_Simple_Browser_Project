== Name ==
The origin of the unusual name is not known for sure and none of the theories can be confirmed through historiography. Couple of theories revolve around the anecdotal historical events in which the phrase nema ni kuće ("[there is] not a [single] house) was uttered. Another possibility is the Celtic-Serbian coinage from nemen, Celtic for glade (geography), and kuća, Serbian for house.
The name is also grammatically problematic. Even the inhabitants are not sure whether to treat it as a singular or plural, or what is the proper declension of the name in grammatical cases, so they use various versions.


== History ==
First written records of the village date from the first half of the 18th century. In 1732 it was said that it had 16 houses. The oldest family in the village were the Vidaković family, which included Serbian novelist Milovan Vidaković. In memory of him, an annual festival "Days of Milovan Vidaković" is held.
