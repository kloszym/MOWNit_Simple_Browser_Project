Pamela Aslı Spence (born 25 February 1973) is a Turkish-English pop-rock singer and actress.
Born to an English father and a Turkish mother, she sings in Turkish, which she learned at the age of 15. She has also collaborated with a number of other Turkish singers and performed in several musicals.
Spence studied Theater Arts at the Ankara State Conservatory. At the age of 19, she had a short-lived marriage to actor Burak Sergen. She was first noticed by critics in a musical version of They Shoot Horses, Don't They? staged in Turkey, where she had acted alongside actors Okan Bayülgen and Fikret Kuşkan. She then starred in TV miniseries such as Lahmacun ve Pizza, and took part in Teoman's group of vocalists.
Her first album, Eğer Dinlersen, was the product of a long period of preparation. With the songs in her second album, Şehir Rehberi, she used a style that was closer to rock music, as opposed to the pop notes of her first album. One of the songs from her second album, "İstanbul", attracted great public attention. In May 2006, she produced her third album, Cehennet.
