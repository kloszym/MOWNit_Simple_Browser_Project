Neochoraki (Greek: Νεοχωράκι, before 1928: Νεοκάζη – Neokazi; Macedonian and Bulgarian: Неокази, Neokazi) is a village in the Florina regional unit, Greece.


== History ==

In 1873, Néokaza, at the time within the Lerin (Florina) kaza in Manastir Sanjak and Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire, was recorded as having 250 households and 630 male Bulgarian inhabitants.
In the early 20th century the British journalist Henry Noel Brailsford noted Neocazi as "a poor Bulgarian hamlet on the plain not far from Florina", burnt by the Turks during the Ilinden Uprising.
The 1920 Greek census recorded 486 people in the village, and 130 inhabitants (26 families) were Muslim in 1923. Following the Greek–Turkish population exchange, Greek refugee families in Neokazi were from Asia Minor (2) and from the Caucasus (29) in 1926. The 1928 Greek census recorded 585 village inhabitants. In 1928, the refugee families numbered 31 (117 people).
