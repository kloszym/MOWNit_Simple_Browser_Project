Cracticus is a genus of butcherbirds native to Australasia. They are large songbirds, being between 30 and 40 cm (12â€“16 in) in length. Their colour ranges from black-and-white to mostly black with added grey plumage, depending on the species. They have a large, straight bill with a distinctive hook at the end which is used to skewer prey. They have high-pitched complex songs, which are used to defend their essentially year-round group territories: unlike birds of extratropical Eurasia and the Americas, both sexes sing prolifically.


== Taxonomy ==
The genus Cracticus was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816 with the hooded butcherbird (Cracticus cassicus) as the type species. The name is from the Ancient Greek kraktikos  meaning "noisy" or "clamorous".
Together with three species of currawong (Strepera) and two species of Peltops, the black butcherbird (Melloria quoyi), and the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), they form the subfamily Cracticinae within the family Artamidae.
The genus contains six species:

The black butcherbird, Melloria quoyi, is sometimes called Cracticus quoyi.
