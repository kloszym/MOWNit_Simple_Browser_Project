In 1977 The New York Times used the phrase "vigorous criticism" to describe opposition by Lake Placid News to "total disregard for the safety of the people who hike the state's trails." The Times noted their reporting about what a local association called "a desecration" of "the only site in the state that has anything to do with the Civil War."
