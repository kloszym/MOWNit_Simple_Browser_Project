The Islamabad Capital Territory has five major types of roadways i.e. expressway(s), highway(s), avenues, khayabans, and roads. The Capital Development Authority's Engineering Wing, under the Ministry of Transportation, maintains over 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) of roadways organised into various classifications which crisscross the territory (mainly Islamabad). These are not to be confused with national highways, which are federal roads maintained by the National Highway Authority, Government of Pakistan.


== Plan of avenues and khayabans ==
According to original plan, all avenues are supposed to run north to south; and all khayabans from east to west. However, there have been several violations of this plan. The worst examples are Jinnah Avenue (which sould be called Khayaban Quaid-i-Azam); Margalla Avenue (which should be called Khayaban Margalla) and Iran Avenue (which should lie only between E-10 and E-11 and not between D-11 and E-11.
