The Pakistani women's cricket team toured Ireland in between 23 July and 2 August 2000 to play against the Irish women's national cricket team in a 5 match WODI series and in a one-off Test match, which was also the first ever Test appearance for Ireland women's cricket team and also marked the first ever Test match to be held in Ireland. 
Originally, the ODI series between the two teams were initially scheduled to be held as a 3 match series but later both Pakistan and Ireland agreed to play in further two WODI matches after the solitary Test finished only within a space of 2 days. Ireland won the WODI series 4-0 and the only Test match. The Irish women's cricket team won the WODI series after winning the first three ODI matches (3-0) just prior to the start of the only Test match, with Ireland winning the 4th One Day International on the next day (on 1 August 2000) after the conclusion of the Test match which ended on 31 July 2000 and the fifth being abandoned due to rain.
The Irish team won the historical Test match on its debut against Pakistan by an innings and 54 runs which was held in Dublin. This was also the only international Test cricket match hosted by Ireland until 2018...
