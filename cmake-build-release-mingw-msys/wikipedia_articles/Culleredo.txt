== Climate ==
Culleredo has a climate that is transitional between the mediterranean (Csb) and oceanic climates (Cfb) due to a sizeable summer drying trend that sits on the threshold between the two classifications. Culleredo is somewhat more prone to extremes than urban A Coruña, but is still heavily influenced by the warm Atlantic sea air in winter and mildened by the same air in summer, that renders the climate very mild for its latitude.
