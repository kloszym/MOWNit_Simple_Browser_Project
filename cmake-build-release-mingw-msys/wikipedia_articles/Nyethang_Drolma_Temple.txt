The Nyethang Drolma Temple (Wylie: snye thang sgrol ma lha khang) is a temple in Nyêtang in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China dedicated to Tara. It is associated with Atiśa (980–1054), who founded the Kadam school of Tibetan Buddhism. The monastery survived the Cultural Revolution relatively undamaged. It is dedicated to Tara, a female bodhisattva, and contains many statues and paintings of Tara.


== Location ==
The Nyethang Drolma Temple is southwest of Lhasa on the Qüshü–Nepal Highway 36 kilometres (22 mi) from the county seat and 33 kilometres (21 mi) from Lhasa. 
It is in Nyétang, Qüxü County. It is easily accessible from Lhasa and many pilgrims visit it. In 2012, the temple had 25 monks. Another source states there are just seven Gelug monks.


== History ==
Atiśa taught the Four Tantras to physicians in the monastery, and later died there.
Some sources say that Atiśa built the monastery, which was expanded after his death by his pupil Dromtön. Another version says that Dromtön raised funds to build the temple to commemorate his old friend. In 1057 Dromtön brought Atisha's body from Nyethang to Reting Monastery, and placed his remains in a stupa built by an Indian artist.
