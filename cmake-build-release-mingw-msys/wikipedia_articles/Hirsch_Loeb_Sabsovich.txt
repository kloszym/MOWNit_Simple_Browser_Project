Hirsch Loeb Sabsovich (1860 â€“ 1915) was a Russian-born Jewish American agronomist, chemist, agricultural educator, Mayor of Woodbine, New Jersey, General Agent of the Baron de Hirsch Fund, and a leader of the Am Olam movement.
Sabsovich was chosen to lead the Woodbine Jewish agricultural community when it was established in the 1890s. When the community was incorporated as a borough in 1903,  around which time about 80% of its residents were Jewish, Sabsovich was elected as Woodbine's first mayor.
