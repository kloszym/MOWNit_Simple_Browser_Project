Ozimops kitcheneri, the south-western free-tailed bat, is a species of molossid bat found in Southwest Australia. A small flying mammal, it forages in forests and woodlands for insects.


== Taxonomy ==
The description as a new species was published in 2014 by McKenzie, Reardon, & Adams, separating them from a poorly understood population known as the planiceps group. This was the result of a revision of the uncertain diversity of several Mormopterus populations, previously recognised by their affinity to species Mormopterus planiceps. Before its publication as a new species, the group were identified as "south-western freetail bat Mormopterus planiceps (long penis form, in part)" (eg Menkhurst, 2011) to separate them from populations in the east and distinguish the short penis form of another group with overlapping range.
The species has been placed with an arrangement of allied taxa as subgenus Mormopterus (Ozimops) Reardon, McKenzie & Adams, 2014. Acknowledgement  by the Australian Faunal Directory as a full species of a new genus cites its recognition by taxonomic authorities in 2015.
