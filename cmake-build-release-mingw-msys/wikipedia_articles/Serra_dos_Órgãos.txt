The Serra dos Órgãos ("Organ Range") is a mountain range in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It contains the Serra dos Órgãos National Park.


== Location ==
The Serra dos Órgãos is the name of the region of the Serra do Mar in the central part of the state of Rio de Janeiro.
It covers an area of 20,024 hectares (49,480 acres).
The range is an escarpment on the northern edge of the Guanabara Graben between the cities of Petrópolis and Teresópolis.
The name comes from perceived resemblance of the vertical rock formations created by erosion to the tubes of organs used in Portuguese churches at the time.

Along the escarpment the altitude ranges from near sea level in the coastal plain to 2,260 metres (7,410 ft) above sea level 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) further inland.
The average elevation is 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) above sea level.
The Dedo de Deus (God's Finger) and Escalavrado, at 1,692 metres (5,551 ft) and 1,490 metres (4,890 ft) and the nearby peaks with steep rock walls are dramatic features that can be seen on a clear day from Rio de Janeiro, which is 50 kilometres (31 mi) distant.
