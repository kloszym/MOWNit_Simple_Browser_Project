Kimitsu Steel Works (Japanese: 君津製鉄所) is an ironworks in Kimitsu, Chiba, Japan, established in 1965 by Nippon Steel Corporation (新日本製鐵), part of Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation after its 2012 merger with Sumitomo Metal Industries.


== History ==
Prior to the construction of its new ironworks, Nippon Steel considered the planned reclaimed land off the coast of Yokkaichi, Mie in Central Japan. Their market research, however, showed the steel demand coming largely from Eastern Japan, especially from the Tokyo-Kawasaki-Yokohama region on the western side of Tokyo Bay, and, therefore, Kimitsu, Chiba on the other side of the bay was selected as the new site.
Kimitsu Steel Works started in 1965 with a cold rolling mill, using the slabs shipped from other ironworks, such as Kamaishi Steel Works in Kamaishi, Iwate and Tokai Steel Works near Nagoya.
In 1968, 1969, 1971 and 1988, the first, second, third and fourth blast furnaces, respectively, were constructed, although the first blast furnace has stopped operation since 1976. Also constructed later were a hot rolling mill and iron bar/iron pipes mills. It became an "integrated" steel works, producing every kind of steel products.
