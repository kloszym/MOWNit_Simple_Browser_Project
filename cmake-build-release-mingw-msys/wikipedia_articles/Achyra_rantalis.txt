It is found in North America, where it has been recorded from Maine to southern Quebec and Ontario, south to Florida and Mexico. It has also been recorded in Iowa, Colorado, California, and the West Indies. Its habitat consists of fields and gardens.

The wingspan is 17–23 millimetres (0.67–0.91 in). There may be up to four generations per year in the south.
The larvae feed on the leaves of various low-growing plants, including alfalfa, beans, clover, corn, cotton, peas and strawberries.
