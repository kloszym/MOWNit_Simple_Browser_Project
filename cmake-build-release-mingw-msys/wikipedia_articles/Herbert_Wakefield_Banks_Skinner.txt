== Biography ==
Skinner was born on 7 October 1900 at 15 Woodville Road, Ealing, London, the only son of George Herbert, director of the shoe firm Lilley & Skinner, and Mabel Elizabeth (née Knight). He was taught at home before starting school, age 9, at Durston House, from where he won a mathematical scholarship to Rugby in 1914. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1919 to read natural sciences and mathematics; he graduated in 1922.
Skinner's research career started in the Cavendish Laboratory where, under the supervision of Charles D Ellis, he worked on the β-ray spectrum of radium B and C. Five years later, in 1927, he moved to the physics department of the University of Bristol, which was headed by Arthur M Tyndall and very well equipped. He investigated  the excitation potentials of lithium and beryllium, and published the results several years later. This research “prepared the way for his outstanding work on the soft X-ray emission spectra of light metals” in the period 1932-1940.
During the war years, Skinner was involved in radar and related techniques. Like other scientists, e...
