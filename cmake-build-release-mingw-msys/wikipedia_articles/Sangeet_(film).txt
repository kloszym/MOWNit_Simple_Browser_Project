Sangeet (Music) is a 1992 Hindi film directed by K. Vishwanath starring Jackie Shroff and Madhuri Dixit in lead roles. Madhuri Dixit had a double role as mother and daughter; she later played similar dual mother and daughter role in Aasoo Bane Angarey, released a year later. Dixit's sensitive portrayal in Sangeet was appreciated; despite the film underperforming at the box office and is considered to be one of her best but underrated performances.
