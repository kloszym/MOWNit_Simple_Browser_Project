Croweology is an acoustic-based album by American rock band The Black Crowes, released on August 3, 2010. The set includes newly recorded versions of nineteen songs from the band's career, covering their albums from Shake Your Money Maker to Lions, plus a cover of the Chris Ethridge and Gram Parsons song "She", in mostly-acoustic arrangements. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated the Crowes capture "the sound of seasoned veterans still finding new ways to play old favorites" and the double album is "a generous, entertaining gift to the fans who have stayed true throughout the years". This would be the last recorded album to feature lead guitarist,  Luther Dickinson. Croweology was the last studio record released by the band before their hiatus lasting from 2013 to 2020.
