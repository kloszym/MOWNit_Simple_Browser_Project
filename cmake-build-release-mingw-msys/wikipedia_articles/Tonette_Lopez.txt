In 2001, Lopez started the Gay Human Rights Movement (GAHUM), based in Cebu City.
Lopez has stated: "Discrimination is very eminent. A country such ours, which is predominantly Roman Catholic is very difficult. Opinions and decisions are always coiled and intertwined with one's religiosity, belief and faith."
