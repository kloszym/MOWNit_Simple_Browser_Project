Gregorio Fontana-Rava (fl. 1830s) was an Italian expatriate supporter of the Risorgimento.
Little is known of his life but he ran a bookshop in Antwerp as a meeting place for Italian patriots. His visit to England in 1833, during which he lectured, in association with Gioacchino Prati, caused some public alarm at his radical views.
