The Spijker V.2 was a conventionally laid out single engine tractor biplane.  Its wings had constant chord and no sweep or stagger.

The tandem open cockpits were fitted with dual controls.
The V.2 was powered by a 60 kW (80 hp) Thulin A (Le Rhône 9C) rotary engine, driving a two blade propeller and enclosed by a 360° or 270° cowling.
