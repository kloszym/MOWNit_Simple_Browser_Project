Think!: Why Crucial Decisions Can't Be Made in the Blink of an Eye is a non-fiction book by editor and journalist Michael R. LeGault, released in January 2006. It was published under Threshold Editions, a conservative publishing imprint under Simon & Schuster run by Mary Matalin.
Think claims to refute Blink, the best-selling 2005 book by Malcolm Gladwell. It argues that United States and the West are in decline because of an intellectual crisis. Think contends that blink-like snap judgments are the cause of major failures such as the Hurricane Katrina response.  Michael LeGault maintains that relying on emotion and instinct instead of reason and facts is ultimately a threat to our freedom and way of life.
