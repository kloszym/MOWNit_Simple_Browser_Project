Sara Wolphaerts van Diemen was baptized in Amsterdam on 6 April 1593 as the daughter of Gerrit Wolphaerts van Diemen and Anna Fabry. Her parents had 9 children and Sara had several brothers and sisters who married into the Amsterdam regency, such as Christina who married Nicolas Balestel, and Anna who married Albert Coenraetsz Burgh. Anna's daughter later married the mayor Nicolaes Tulp. Sara became engaged to the wealthy widower Nicolaes Hasselaer, who lived on the Keizersgracht, on 14 August 1622. He had first married Geertruyt van Erp (1596-1620) and had a son Gerrit by her. She probably died in childbirth. Sara raised Gerrit to be a mayor of Amsterdam and she also had three daughters, of whom Anna married Marten Ruychaver van Loon and later Pieter van Dam, and Geertruid married Cornelis van Werckhoven. Sara outlived her husband by 35 years and died in Amsterdam on 1 May 1667.
