Govindpur Area is one of the 12 operational areas of BCCL located in Dhanbad Sadar subdivision of Dhanbad district in the state of Jharkhand, India.


== History ==
“Mining in Jharia coalfield was started 150 years back and most of the mines were open cast with manual excavations. Gradually underground mines were started at shallow depth and the mining was done by the private mine operators. Due to complex geo-mining conditions, the private mine operators abandoned the mines without taking care of the safety, conservation of the post mining situations. The unscientific mining has created many small surface craters or unsafe goaf in the Jharia coalfield area. After nationalization, Coal India has taken efforts for reorganization of mines and scientific extraction of the coal through the old and existing mines.”
