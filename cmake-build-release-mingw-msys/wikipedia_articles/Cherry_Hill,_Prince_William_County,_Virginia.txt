== History ==
The eastern side of the peninsula was long occupied by low-density single-family homes, while the western side remained more industrial. This changed with the construction of Southbridge on the Potomac, a master-planned community of approximately 1,500 homes on 600 acres of land in southwestern Cherry Hill, founded in 1990 and built largely from the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s; River Oaks, a community consisting of 1,122 homes was built during the same time period just to the north of Southbridge on the Potomac.
The smaller community of Eagle Pointe was built in the late 2000s in western Cherry Hill, in between U.S. Route 1 and Interstate 95, as were Port Potomac and the single-family house section of Powells Landing, located just across U.S. Route 1 from Eagle Pointe. The townhouse section of Powell's Landing was built in the mid-2010s.
