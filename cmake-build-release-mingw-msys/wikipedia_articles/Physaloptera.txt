== Physaloptera spp. as human parasites ==

Most species utilize insects such as crickets, cockroaches, and beetles as intermediate hosts. Several species of Physaloptera can parasitize primates, including humans. This rare disease is known as spiruridiasis.
Human infection is considered to be ancient; eggs of Physaloptera sp. were found in a grave of the Bronze Age in Iran.
