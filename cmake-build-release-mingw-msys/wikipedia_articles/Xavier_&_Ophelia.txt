Xavier and Ophelia is an American indie rock and electropop music duo based in Nashville. Formed in 2009, members include DeAnna Moore (vocals) and Dave Tough (keyboards, guitar, bass). They have released two albums including their debut Xavier & Ophelia, which had songs win industry awards. "Falling Down," a track from their 2012 sophomore album I Hate Birds, won Grand Prize at the 2013 John Lennon Songwriting Contest. Their songs have been placed in movies, television and commercials, and in 2013 their song "Heartbeat" was featured on Twisted, an ABC Family show.
According to Raw Ramp, "their sounds combine easy-listening melodies with electronic pop elements...[and] the angelic voice of DeAnna Moore is always centre-stage." Much of their music utilizes both live instruments and electronic production. The duo often performs live with a backing band, with regular venues including The Bluebird Cafe in Nashville.
