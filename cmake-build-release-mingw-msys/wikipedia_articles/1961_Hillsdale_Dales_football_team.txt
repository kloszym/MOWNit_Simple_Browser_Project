The 1961 Hillsdale Dales football team was an American football team that represented Hillsdale College as an independent member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics during the 1961 college football season. In their eighth year under head coach Muddy Waters, the Dales compiled a 6â€“3 record.
Hillsdale appeared in the Mineral Water Bowl after the 1960 season and was suspended by the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA) for breaking the conference prohibition on post-season competition. Hillsdale refused to accept the suspension and withdrew from the conference, competing as an independent in 1961.
