TruGreen, originally known as ChemLawn and later as TruGreen ChemLawn, is the largest lawn care company in the United States. The company was founded in 1969 and provides lawn care and tree and shrub care treatments on a subscription basis (except in New York where it is by contract basis). The treatments and services include weed killing, moss suppression, pesticides, insect control, disease management, aeration, overseeding, and fertilizing. The company neither offers lawn mowing service or landscaping as a sellable service. Tree and shrub services as well as several insect control programs are offered by TruGreen.
The TruGreen brand is also used for lawn services in Canada through a Mississauga, Ontarioâ€“based company named Greenlawn Ltd. that does business as TruGreen. The TruGreen brand, under Servicemaster, also is used in the United Kingdom.
The company's history includes several changes of ownership and the absorption of other lawn servicing operations including ChemGreen (originally founded in 1974) and Scotts LawnService (originally founded as Emerald Green Lawn Service before its purchase in 1997 by the Scotts Miracle-Gro Company).
