== Chudleigh Knighton Heath ==
The nearby Chudleigh Knighton Heath, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, is a habitat for many rare species including the ant, Formica exsecta. The Heath was once the village's main football pitch and was the venue for many sports days for the primary school. The Heath became so run down it was almost impossible to navigate, so the school opened its own private sports field opposite the village play park.
