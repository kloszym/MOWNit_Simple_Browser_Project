Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (transl.â€‰Toilet: A Love 
Story) or simply Toilet, is a 2017 Indian Hindi-language comedy-drama film directed by Shree Narayan Singh. Co-produced by Akshay Kumar and Neeraj Pandey, the film stars Akshay Kumar and Bhumi Pednekar, with campaigns to improve sanitation conditions in India, with an emphasis on the eradication of open defecation, which, before the Swachh Bharat mission, was still a problem, especially in rural areas.
Up until then, the lack of infrastructure led to nearly half of the rural population defecating in the open (2015). In 2021 though, this amount had greatly decreased to 15% for the general population (1% for urban areas, and 22% for rural areas). It was reported that the movie is based on the true story of Anita Narre from Madhya Pradesh, who refused to go back to her husband Shivram's home because it had no toilet. In fact, after the ending of the film, a photograph of Narre couple is shown with Bhumi Pednekar, and this fact is mentioned as a subtitle. In the beginning of the film too, it is narrated that the film is inspired by a true incident, although the name of real characters comes only towards the end.
The film released on 11 August...
