Trinidadian Creole is an  creole language commonly spoken throughout the island of Trinidad in Trinidad and Tobago. It is distinct from Tobagonian Creole – particularly at the basilectal level – and from other Lesser Antillean creoles.
English is the country's official language (the national standard variety is Trinidadian and Tobagonian English), but the main spoken languages are Trinidadian Creole and Tobagonian Creole. Prior to English being designated as the country’s official language, a French mixed with formerly enslaved  African languages type of Creole was more prominent throughout the island amongst former slaves. 
English became the country's official language in 1823. Consequently, government and educational institutions endorsement of the language change significantly and influenced the progressive transition and phaseout of the former French mixed Creole to an English based Creole, that is now more widely spoken. 
Both creoles contain elements from a variety of other languages, brought to the island over time by mostly African slaves and East Indian settlers. As of 2011, there were 1 million native speakers.
