== Background ==
Kodama was born in Osaka, Japan in 1967 and raised in Germany and Paris, France due to her father's postings in these countries as well as in Switzerland and England. She and her sister Momo are the daughters of a pianist mother and banker father. Their mother gave up performances for teaching and Mari assuming everyone played piano.  She wanted to begin playing at age 2, but her parents thought she was too young. She was able to read notes by age three. By the age of 10, she decided to be a concert pianist by not returning to Japan to prepare for university. She studied piano at the Conservatoire de Paris starting at age 14 under Germaine Mounier, and chamber music under Geneviève Joy-Dutilleux. She performed in various European competitions while still a teenager. She made her Japanese debut in 1984 at age 17 and was immediately a success.
