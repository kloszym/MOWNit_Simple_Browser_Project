== Early life ==
He was of Hakka Chinese descent, born the fifth of 12 children to Gladstone Vernon and Maisie Chang in Kingston, Jamaica. His father was a second generation Chinese Jamaican born to Chinese immigrants while his mother was born in Guyana, also of Chinese Guyanese descent.  Upon the death of Maisie's brother, Chang's parents adopted five of their then-orphaned nieces and nephew. This newly blended and inter-related family now comprised 12 children and was raised together with Chang's other cousins on two back-to-back streets on which were constructed five houses, each built for an individual "Chang" family. In total, 35 cousins lived side-by-side "around-the-block" of five houses. Gladstone and Maisie, along with Gladstone's brothers and sisters, owned a successful bakery and several, other businesses on the island. From an early age, Gladstone and Maisie Chang insisted that all 12 children pursue a university education; after he was educated as St. George's College, Jamaica.
