At LSU, Linden distinguished himself as a switch hitter by setting a Southeastern Conference record for games in a season with home runs hit from both sides of the plate. After the 2000 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star. Nicknamed "Moose" by his Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees teammates after a horrible offensive showing in Charlotte, where he was visibly frustrated by a Charlotte Knights fan in the front row who berated him with moose references.
