Discovery+ (pronounced "Discovery Plus"; stylized as discovery+) is an American multinational subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service owned by Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). The service focuses on factual programming drawn from the libraries of Discovery's main channel brands, as well as original series (including spin-offs of programs from Discovery's television networks), and content from A&E Networks, NBCUniversal, ABS-CBN Studios, and Discovery+â€™s corporate sibling CNN.
It was first launched in India on March 23, 2020. It launched in the United States on January 4, 2021, and replaced Discovery's Dplay and Eurosport Player services in Europe the next day. As of April 1, 2022, Discovery+ has 24 million subscribers.
Discovery+ became a sister service to WarnerMedia's HBO Max following their merger in April 2022. HBO Max was relaunched as Max the following year, adding Discovery content to its library. While WBD originally planned to discontinue Discovery+ in favor of Max, the company elected to continue offering Discovery+ because it was still profitable.
