1-2-3 Corona is an East German film directed by Hans Müller. It was released in 1948.


== Plot ==
In ruined Berlin, several bands of abandoned children roam the streets, engaging in petty crimes. When a circus arrives nearby, the boys are charmed by one trapeze performer called Corona. They are upset when the circus' manager insults her, and plan revenge by setting a trap on the ring. But their scheme fails and it is Corona that is injured. Being unable to work, she is dismissed.  
The boys tend to her, and as time passes, she teaches them her art, and they form a little circus of their own. A manager of another circus offers Corona a job. She is reluctant to leave the children. Eventually, the manager takes them all into his circus.
