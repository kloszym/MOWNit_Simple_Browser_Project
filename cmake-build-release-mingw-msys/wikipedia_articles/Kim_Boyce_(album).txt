== Critical reception ==
Evan Cater of AllMusic gave the album 2.5 out of 5 stars stating that: "The result is a wildly uneven sugar puff of utterly white-bread synthesized lite pop. A few of the tunes here are catchy enough to obscure the grating qualities of Boyce's frequently shrill vocals. The appealingly minor-key "Darkened Hearts," the effective formula ballad "Here," and—especially—the unexpected cover of Alison Moyet's "Love Resurrection" get the album off to a promising start, thanks in large part to the immaculate synthesized sheen of Brian Tankersley's production. But the rest of the album (with the exception of the silly but engaging "Sing and Dance") is almost unbearably flabby."
