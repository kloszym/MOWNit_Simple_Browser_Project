The Siemens-Schuckert D.IV was a late-World War I fighter aircraft from Siemens-Schuckert (SSW). It reached service too late and was produced in too few numbers to have any effect on the war effort.

Siemens-Schuckert's first production fighter aircraft was the Siemens-Schuckert D.I, which was based closely on the French Nieuport 17. Apart from the use of the Siemens-Halske Sh.I, a geared rotary engine in which the crankshaft and the propeller rotated in opposite directions, the D.I was in fact a fairly close copy of the Nieuport. By the time production D.Is appeared in 1917 however, the design was no longer competitive and after 95 had been built, production was cancelled, with the type serving mainly as an advanced trainer.
Development work on the Siemens-Halske Sh.I culminated in the Siemens-Halske Sh.III, which developed 160 PS (120 kW; 160 hp). The new engine was fitted to a series of original prototype designs from the SSW works, the D.II, D.IIa and D.IIb. These featured a short, round section fuselage designed to fit a larger engine, leading to a rather stubby-looking aircraft which pilots later referred to as the flying beer barrel.
