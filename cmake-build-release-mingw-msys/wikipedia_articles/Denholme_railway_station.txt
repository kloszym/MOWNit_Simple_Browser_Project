== History ==
The station was built by the Great Northern Railway in 1884, almost 1‚ÅÑ2 mile (0.8 km) from the town of Denholme, West Yorkshire, England. By road, the station was accessed by an unlit and downhill road (Station Road) from the village. The station had an island platform which was accessed by a long iron footbridge which spanned the down tracks. The site also housed a goods yard, with stone-built shed, stables, and numerous sidings - with coal and timber being the principal traffic, as evident from photographs of the site whilst it was still in operation. The station master's house (Station House) was built adjacent to and overlooking the site. There were railway tunnels at either end of the site.

The site was then purchased by a timber merchant and converted to a large timber yard. The timber yard closed in 2012 and the site is now...
