Wallerian degeneration is an active process of degeneration that results when a nerve fiber is cut or crushed and the part of the axon distal to the injury (which in most cases is farther from the neuron's cell body) degenerates. A related process of  dying back or retrograde degeneration known as 'Wallerian-like degeneration' occurs in many neurodegenerative diseases, especially those where axonal transport is impaired such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease. Primary culture studies suggest that a failure to deliver sufficient quantities of the essential axonal protein NMNAT2 is a key initiating event. Some studies also have found irreversible electroporation, a potential clinical treatment being researched in porcine models to determine efficacy to treat spinal cord injuries, has contributed to Wallerian degeneration of lumbar nerve roots.  
Wallerian degeneration occurs after axonal injury in both the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). It occurs in the section of the axon distal to the site of injury and usually begins within 24â€“36 hours of a lesion. Prior to degeneration, the distal section of the axon tends to remain electrically...
