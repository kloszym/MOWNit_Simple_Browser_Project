The 1993 San Francisco 49ers season was the franchise's 44th season in the National Football League (NFL) and their 48th overall. The 49ers appeared in the NFC Championship Game for the second consecutive season and for the fifth time in six seasons. For the first time since 1978, Joe Montana was not on their active roster; specifically, the 49ers had traded him away to the Kansas City Chiefs in April.

The 49ers' NFC West division championship and 10–6 regular-season record earned them the #2 seed in the NFC and a first-round bye in the playoffs. The Detroit Lions, the NFC Central division winners, also had a 10–6 regular-season record, but the 49ers had the tie-breaker edge because they defeated the Lions in the regular season. The Dallas Cowboys, winners of the NFC East with a 12–4 regular-season record, had the #1 seed and a first-round bye of their own.
