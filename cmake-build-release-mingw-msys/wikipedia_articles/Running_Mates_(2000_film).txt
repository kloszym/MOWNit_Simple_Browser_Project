Running Mates is a 2000 American made-for-television political comedy-drama film directed by Ron Lagomarsino and starring Tom Selleck. The film follows the presidential election campaign of James Pryce, a Democratic Party presidential candidate, who has a hard time deciding whom to pick as his vice-presidential running mate. Laura Linney, Nancy Travis, Faye Dunaway, and Teri Hatcher also star as Pryce's current or former love interests who have had a major influence on his success so far, but who also have a great deal of control over his decisions.
Created for Turner Entertainment, Running Mates was initially aired on TNT on the night of August 13, 2000, and has since been broadcast in Australia, Hungary, Iceland, and Sweden. Faye Dunaway's performance in the film earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television, which she lost to Vanessa Redgrave for her work in If These Walls Could Talk 2.
