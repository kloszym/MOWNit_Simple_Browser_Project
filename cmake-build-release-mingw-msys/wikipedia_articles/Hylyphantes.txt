Hylyphantes is a genus of dwarf spiders that was first described by Eugène Louis Simon in 1884. It is distinct from related genera by a pair of spiral copulatory ducts in the female, which are matched by a turbinated embolus in the male. Both sexes are similar in appearance; the male has no modifications.
