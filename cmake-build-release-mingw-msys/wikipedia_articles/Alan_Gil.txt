Alan Gil is an Australian former rugby league player.
Born to a Spanish father and Irish mother, Gil was raised in Cairns, attending St Augustine's College.
Gil captain-coached local Cairns club the Kangaroos, partnering his brother Neil in the centres, while another brother Frank was their five-eighth. In 1958, Gil was named best on ground for Far North Queensland in their match against Great Britain, a performance that saw him signed by a club in Toowoomba. He captained the Toowoomba representative side to the 1960 Bulimba Cup title, before returning to Cairns.
In 1962, Gil represented Australia as a centre in the 2nd and 3rd Tests against Great Britain.
