Daicel Corporation (株式会社ダイセル, Kabushiki gaisha Daiseru) is a chemical company based in Japan.

The company's products include cellulose acetate, tow for cigarette filters, high-performance chemicals, engineering plastics like liquid crystal polymers (LPCs), resin compounds, and automotive airbag inflators.
The company formed under the name of Dainippon Celluloid Company from a 1919 merger of eight regional celluloid manufacturers and changed its name to the present one in 1966. Its first subsidiary, Fuji Photo Film, was set up in 1934 to produce nitrocellulose film. Eventually this company became Fujifilm.
