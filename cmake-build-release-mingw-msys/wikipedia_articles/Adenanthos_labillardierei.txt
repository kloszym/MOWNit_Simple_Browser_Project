Adenanthos labillardierei is a species of erect shrub endemic to the slopes of the Barren Ranges in the Fitzgerald River National Park in southwest Western Australia.

Flowers are dark claret at the apex, but range from cream to claret at the base. The perianth tube may be up to 25 mm long, and the style up to 33 mm long.
This species is very similar in appearance to its close relative A. filifolius, but the latter has cream and black or dark navy blue flowers, and leaves with many more laciniae than A. labillardierei.

In fact, he had included a brief description of the species in a descriptive key in a paper published earlier that year, but this did not constitute valid publication of the name. Nelson based his concept of...
