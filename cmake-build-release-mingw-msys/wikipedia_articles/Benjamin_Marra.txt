Benjamin Marra (born 1977 in Halifax, Nova Scotia) is a Grammy-nominated American illustrator and comic-book artist.

The first comic book to leave an impression on Marra was Darick Robertson's Space Beaver, a hyper-violent science-fiction story featuring an anthropomorphic beaver, which has served as an inspiration for his later work.
