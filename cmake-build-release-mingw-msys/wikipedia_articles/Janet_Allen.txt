Janet Katherine Allen is an American biochemist and industrial engineer whose research concerns uncertainty in the engineering design process and its quantification and control through robust design processes, statistical methods, simulation of alternative designs, and the use of the design of experiments to systematically explore alternatives in large design spaces. She is a professor of industrial and systems engineering at the University of Oklahoma, where she holds the John and Mary Moore Chair of Engineering.


== Education and career ==
Allen earned a bachelor's degree in life sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1967. She completed a Ph.D. in biophysics at the University of California, Berkeley in 1973.
After postdoctoral research at the University of Southern California, she moved in 1975 to the University of New South Wales in Australia, as a professional officer in the department of biochemistry, part-time lecturer in the Centre for Biomedical Engineering, and scientist at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. She returned to the US in 1981, as a researcher in biochemistry at Rice University and, for the next several years, at Baylor University.
