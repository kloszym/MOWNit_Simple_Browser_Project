Flinders Highway runs parallel to the western coast of the Eyre Peninsula through undulating farmland. It is named after the explorer Matthew Flinders who sighted these coasts in early 1802 from HMS Investigator. Only small settlements lie along its track: of these, Coffin Bay is a centre for oyster farming, Elliston is renowned for swimming beaches and fishing and Ceduna is the main town on the far west coast of South Australia supporting government offices and businesses.
