Phạm Xuân Chiểu (November 20, 1920 – August 7, 2018) was an infantry general of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, with the rank of Lieutenant General. He came from the Martial Arts School established by the Army of Vietnam Nationalist Party in the Northwestern region of North Vietnam, training Vietnamese people in parties to serve the resistance forces. Some later joined the French Union Army. During his time in the army, he was always assigned to take on positions related to consulting, so the consulting field can be considered as his specialty. He was also one of the few officers promoted to the rank of general during the First Republic period (Major General in early 1957). This proves that he himself was favored by President Ngô Đình Diệm. However in the 1963 coup, he was a member of the leading group of generals.
