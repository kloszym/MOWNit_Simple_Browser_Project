The  TVR Tamora is a 2-seater sports car built from 2002 by British company TVR, filling the gap left by the company's Chimaera and Griffith models. Introduced at the 2000 Birmingham Motor Show, the car is named after Tamora, a character in William Shakespeare's play Titus Andronicus and served as an entry-level model in the TVR range. Peter Wheeler was no longer directly responsible for design and the car was designed by a team led by Damian McTaggart (also responsible for the interior), but Wheeler still had final approval.


== History and development ==

The Tamora was intended to be a more practical and urban-friendly model in the TVR range. Based on the Tuscan Speed Six, the Tamora used the same chassis and suspension as the Tuscan. The engine was a short-stroked version of the 4.0 litre Speed Six found on the Tuscan now displacing 3.6 litres. Keeping with TVR tradition, the car still lacked driver's aids such as ABS and traction control, but was fitted with a power steering and a softer clutch for easy manoeuvrability. The Tamora was not a sales success due to reliability issues, high price and divisive styling. Only 356 cars were made before it was discontinued in 2006.
