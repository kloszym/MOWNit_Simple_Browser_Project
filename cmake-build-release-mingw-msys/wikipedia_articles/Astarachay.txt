The Astarachay (Talysh: Ostororü, Persian: آستاراچای, Azerbaijani: Astaraçay) is a small river that defines the eastern border between Iran and Azerbaijan in Western Asia.
The river discharges into the Caspian Sea. After flowing in a canyon through the Alborz mountain range, it reaches its mouth on the southwestern Caspian coast.
The Astarachay is partially in Gilan Province of far northwestern Iran.
