The "Mountain Attack" is an annual Austrian ski mountaineering competition, carried out near Saalbach since 1999.
The competition is separated in a short distance and a long distance course, each offered for a female and a male racer class. There is a separate ranking of racers, older than 45 years. The marathon track passes six summits, and includes an altitude difference of 3,000 meters for the total ascent and for skiing down.
