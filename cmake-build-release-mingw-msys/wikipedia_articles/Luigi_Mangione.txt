Luigi Nicholas Mangione (  MAN-jee-OH-nee; born May 6, 1998) is an American man who has been identified as the suspect in the killing of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare.
Thompson was shot to death in New York City on December 4, 2024. Following a nationwide manhunt, Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, five days after the shooting. He has been indicted on eleven state charges and four federal charges, including first-degree murder, murder in furtherance of terrorism, criminal possession of a weapon, and stalking. Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in Mangione's federal case. 
Mangione has been described as the "most debated and polarizing murder suspect in recent history". Since his arrest, he has been celebrated as a folk hero by supporters. Opinion polls have found that American adult respondents are more likely than not to hold a negative view toward Mangione, with younger and liberal respondents being more likely than others to view him favorably. The support Mangione has generated has been connected to negative opinions of the U.S. health insurance industry and claim denial practices.
