The organization was founded as the "Canadian Association for Retarded Children". In 1969, the name was changed, to "Canadian Association for the Mentally Retarded". The current name was adopted in 1985.
In 1963, the organization established the "Canadian John F. Kennedy Memorial Fund for Retarded Children". The money raised went to the organization and was used to fund research.
A "Canadian Retarded Children's Week" was also established in 1964 for fundraising, to run from May 6 to 16. The theme was "Flowers of Hope". Cosmos seeds were mailed out as a part of fundraising efforts.
