== Nomenclature ==

β Coronae Borealis (Latinised to Beta Coronae Borealis) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two components as Beta Coronae Borealis A and B derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).
It bore the traditional name Nusakan, from Arabic النسقان al-nasaqān "the two lines [of stars]", originally a pair of asterisms - a northern line mostly in Hercules, and a southern line in Serpens and Ophiuchus.
