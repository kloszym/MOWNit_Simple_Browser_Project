Pannoparmelia is a genus of lichenised ascomycetes in the large family Parmeliaceae. It is a genus of five currently accepted species. Pannoparmelia species have a foliose growth habit. All members of the family have a symbiotic association with green alga and the majority of Parmeliaceae species have foloiose. The morphological diversity is enormous within this group and the specimen are difficult to identify in its species level. There are a range of habitats and climatic regions within this family and it includes tropical rainforest trees to subshrubs in Arctic tundra.[3]


== Etymology ==
The name Pannoparmelia comes from the Latin term pannosus, which means 'felt-like texture'. This is a reference to the noticeably spongy thallus exhibited by species in this genus.
