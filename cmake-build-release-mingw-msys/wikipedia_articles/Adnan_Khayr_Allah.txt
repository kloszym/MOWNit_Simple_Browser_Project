Colonel General Adnan Khairallah (Arabic: عدنان خير الله طلفاح, romanized: ʿAdnān Khayr Allāḥ; 1940 – 4 May 1989) was an Iraqi military officer and Saddam Hussein's brother in-law and cousin. He held several titles and was a member of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council. He also served as the Defence Minister of Iraq from 1979 until his death a decade later, being appointed days after Saddam Hussein succeeded to the Presidency. 
He died in 1989 in a helicopter crash that was officially labeled an accident. The circumstances surrounding his death, including his disputes with Saddam and rumors of a potential coup, have led some to believe Adnan was assassinated under orders from Saddam.


== Early life and education ==
Adnan was born in Tikrit in 1940, the son of Khairallah Talfah, an Arab nationalist officer in the Iraqi Army who was later involved in the 1941 Iraqi coup d'état and the ensuing Anglo-Iraqi War. Adnan's father was also the maternal uncle of Saddam Hussein, who would later marry Adnan's sister, Sajida. Adnan attended the Baghdad Military College and the Staff College, and later graduated with a degree from the Baghdad University School of Law and Politics in 1975.
