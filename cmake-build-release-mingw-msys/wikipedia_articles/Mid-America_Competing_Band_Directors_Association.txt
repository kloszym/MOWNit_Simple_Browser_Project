The Mid-America Competing Band Directors Association (MACBDA) was a governing body and summer high school marching band competition circuit based in the Upper Midwest.
The circuit's competitive season traditionally began in June, and previously included field, parade, and concert band competitions hosted throughout the Midwestern United States. Beginning in 2008, almost all competitive events were hosted in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and were limited to field band competitions with occasional parade band presentations.
The most recent circuit championship was at Perkins Stadium, in Whitewater, Wisconsin on July 14, 2019. The association had twenty-five member bands in 2008, but only five remained active as of July 2018. Competitions were not held in 2020â€“21 due to the Covid pandemic. As of the 2022 season, the association has not scheduled any competitions.
