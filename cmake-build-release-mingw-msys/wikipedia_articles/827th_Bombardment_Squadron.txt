The 827th Bombardment Squadron is a former United States Army Air Forces unit.  It was last assigned to the 484th Bombardment Group at Casablanca Airport, French Morocco, where it was inactivated on 25 July 1945.
The squadron was first activated as the 41st Bombardment Squadron as the United States expanded its military following the outbreak of World War II.  Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the squadron performed antisubmarine warfare missions off the Atlantic coast of the United States, and was redesignated as the 5th Antisubmarine Squadron.
After the Army Air Forces antisubmarine mission was transferred to the Navy, the squadron acted as the cadre for a new Consolidated B-24 Liberator group as the 827th Bombardment Squadron.  It served in combat in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, where it participated in the strategic bombing campaign against Germany.  It earned two Distinguished Unit Citations for operations over Germany and Austria.  Following V-E Day it operated with Air Transport Command, returning American troops to the United States until it was inactivated in theater in 1945.
