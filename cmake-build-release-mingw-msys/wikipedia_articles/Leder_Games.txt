== History ==
Leder Games was founded by Patrick Leder in 2014. Leder had been involved in board game design in his free time since 2001, obtained degrees in English and psychology at Hamline University, and quit his database programming job at Macalester College in 2016 to work on the company.


== Business model ==
Leder Games relies on the Kickstarter platform as both a funding and marketing tool. It focuses on releasing fewer, larger games in order to build anticipation, rather than releasing a large number of games each year.
