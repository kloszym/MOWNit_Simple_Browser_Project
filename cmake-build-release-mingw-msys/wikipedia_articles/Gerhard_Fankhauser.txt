Gerhard Fankhauser (1901â€“1981) was an embryologist known for his studies on amphibian development. He was a professor at Princeton from 1931 to 1969, where he retired as the Edwin Grant Conklin Professor of Biology.
Frankhauser was born in Burgdorf, Switzerland in 1901. He received his doctorate from the University of Bern in 1924 and came to the United States in 1929 as a Rockefeller research fellow at the University of Chicago. Fankhauser completed his doctorate under Fritz Baltzer and has trained Alan Humphries, who studied frog oocytes at Emory University.

Gerhard Fankhauser's wife, Erna Fankhauser, worked as a language instructor and died in a head-on collision on November 6, 1954.
