Csárdás (, US: ; Hungarian: [ˈt͡ʃaːrdaːʃ]), often seen as Czárdás, is a traditional Hungarian folk dance, the name derived from csárda (old Hungarian term for roadside tavern and restaurant). It originated in Hungary and was popularized by bands in Hungary as well as neighboring countries and regions such as of Slovenia, Burgenland, Croatia, Transylvania, Slovakia, Vojvodina and Moravia, as well as among the Banat Bulgarians, including those in Bulgaria.


== History ==

The origin of the csárdás was a death dance, when the soldier fought with his opponent, watched him, watched his weak points, then as a victor killed him and danced in joy with the others.
So the origin of the csárdás can be traced back to the Turkish wars.
The csárdás is characterized by a variation in tempo: it starts out slowly (lassú) and ends in a very fast tempo (friss, literally "fresh"). There are other tempo variations, called ritka csárdás, sűrű csárdás and szökős csárdás. The music is in 24 or 44 time. The dancers are both male and female, with the women dressed in traditional wide skirts, which form a distinctive shape when they whirl.
