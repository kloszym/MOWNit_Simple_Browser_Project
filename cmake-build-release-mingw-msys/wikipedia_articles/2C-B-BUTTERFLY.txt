2C-B-BUTTERFLY (2C-B-MOTH, 2C-B-BFLY) is a conformationally-restricted derivative of the hallucinogen 2C-B and a member of the phenethylamine, 2C, and FLY families. It was discovered in 1999 by Michael S. Whiteside and Aaron Monte. It is a ring-expanded homologue of the better known compound 2C-B-FLY, and has similar properties as an agonist for serotonin receptors, but with more selectivity for 5-HT2C over 5-HT2A.
