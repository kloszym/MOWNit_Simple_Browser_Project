Lillie Hall was a disused roller skating or ice skating rink off Seagrave Road (just south of Roxby Place, next to the rail line), Fulham, London, that in 1902 (or January 1903) became Charles Rolls' first car showroom, to sell imported French Peugeot and Belgian Minerva vehicles. Rolls went on to co-found the Rolls-Royce company in 1906.

Rolls received an annual allowance of £500 from his father, who gave him a further £6,600 to start his business, as an advance against the £20,000 he was due to inherit on his father's death, and Lillie Hall opened to the public in 1903 with a "grand reception".
