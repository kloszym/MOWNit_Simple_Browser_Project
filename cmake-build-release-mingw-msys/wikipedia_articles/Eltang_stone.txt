The Eltang stone (also Stenderup stone, listed as DR  35 in the Rundata catalog (DK SJy 1), is a Viking Age runestone (now at the National Museum of Denmark, catalogue nr. D 52/1950).
The stone was discovered in 1866 at North-Stenderup,  Eltang parish, Kolding Municipality, Region of Southern Denmark, Denmark, about 2 km northeast of Kolding, on the estate of one Mr. Flensbourg, who gave it to the Oldnordisk Museum (which merged into the National Museum of Denmark in 1892).
The Danske Runeindskrifter database of the Copenhagen University's Nordisk Forskningsinstitut dates it to the later Viking Age (the range of AD 900-1200 cited as a "fairly safe" estimate).
It is a granite slab, measuring 66 cm high and 60 cm wide at a thickness between 4 and 10 cm. The lower right part of the slab is broken off, but the runic inscription is preserved in its entirety.
The inscription consists of nine runic horizontal staves, running top to bottom, enclosed in a frame.

The inscription is discussed in greater detail by George Stephens (1868).
Stephens places it in the 9th...
