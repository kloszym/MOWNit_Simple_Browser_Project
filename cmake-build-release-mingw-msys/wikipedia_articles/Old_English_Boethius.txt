The Old English Boethius is an Old English translation/adaptation of the sixth-century Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius, dating from between c. 880 and 950. Boethius's work is prosimetrical, alternating between prose and verse, and one of the two surviving manuscripts of the Old English translation renders the poems as Old English alliterative verse: these verse translations are known as the Metres of Boethius.
The translation is attributed in one manuscript to King Alfred (r. 870â€“899), and this was long accepted, but the attribution is now considered doubtful.


== Manuscripts ==
The Old English Consolation texts are known from three medieval manuscripts/fragments and an early modern copy:

Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 180 (known as MS B). Produced at the end of the eleventh century or the beginning of the twelfth), translating the whole of the Consolation (prose and verse) into prose.
London, British Library, Cotton MS Otho A.vi (known as MS C). Mid-tenth century. This contains a prose translation of Boethius's prose largely identical to MS B, but gives verse translations of the metres. The manuscript is imperfect due to damage in the Ashburnham House fire of 1731.
