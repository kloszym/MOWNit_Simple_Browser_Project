Air Force Plants NC (NAA-K company ID, Government Assembly Plant No. 2,  facility ID #2503) was an aircraft production facility established during World War II adjacent to Fairfax Field near Kansas City. Although operated by North American Aviation, the plant was built and owned by the United States government.


== Background ==
North American Aviation's president had inspected the field by December 1940 when the US government approved construction of a Kansas City production plant to produce B-25 Mitchell bombers for the USAAF and PBJ-1D bombers for the US Navy.  Survey work began in December, the city of Kansas City, Kansas, purchased the airport in February, and the plant's groundbreaking was on 8 March 1941.  Contract W535 AC 19341 for the initial production of 1,200 B-25D (NA-87) bombers was approved on June 28, 1941; production began in December 1941.


== B-25 production ==
Fairfax's first B-25D was accepted by the USAAF in February 1942 (the first production block was B-25D-1).  North American provided parts for the first 100 Fairfax B-25Ds from AFP #09 in Inglewood, California, and the company had a test flight office at Fairfax.
A USAAF Modification Center was built at Fairfax...
