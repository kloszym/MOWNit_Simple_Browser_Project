== History ==
Pulaski was constructed in 1892-94 and opened in March 1894 as part of the Lake Street Elevated Railroad. The station was constructed in the Queen Anne architectural style, as were the other Lake Street stations. In 1956, Pulaski's platforms were lengthened by 200 feet from the east end and additional entrances to the station were opened at Harding Avenue after the closing of the nearby Hamlin station. The Harding Avenue entrance to the eastbound platform became exit-only in 1960, but the westbound entrance remained open. Pulaski was rebuilt in 1973, and the original station houses were demolished at this time. On December 18, 1993, the westbound Harding Avenue exit closed. In 1994 Pulaski closed along with the rest of the Green Line so it could be rebuilt. The platforms at the station were completely rebuilt during its closure, but the original fare controls were kept, so the old platforms were converted into walkways...
