In geometry, the great dodecahemicosahedron (or great dodecahemiicosahedron) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U65. It has 22 faces (12 pentagons and 10 hexagons), 60 edges, and 30 vertices. Its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral.
It is a hemipolyhedron with ten hexagonal faces passing through the model center.

Its convex hull is the icosidodecahedron. It also shares its edge arrangement with the dodecadodecahedron (having the pentagonal faces in common), and with the small dodecahemicosahedron (having the hexagonal faces in common).


=== Great dodecahemicosacron ===

The great dodecahemicosacron is the dual of the great dodecahemicosahedron, and is one of nine dual hemipolyhedra. It appears visually indistinct from the small dodecahemicosacron.
Since the hemipolyhedra have faces passing through the center, the dual figures have corresponding vertices at infinity; properly, on the real projective plane at infinity. In Magnus Wenninger's Dual Models, they are represented with intersecting prisms, each extending in both directions to the same vertex at infinity, in order to maintain symmetry. In practice, the model prisms are cut off at a certain...
