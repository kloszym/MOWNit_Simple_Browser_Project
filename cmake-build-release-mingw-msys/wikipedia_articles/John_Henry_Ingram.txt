John Henry Ingram (November 16, 1842 â€“ February 12, 1916) was an English biographer and editor with a special interest in Edgar Allan Poe.
Ingram was born at 29 City Road, Finsbury Square, Middlesex, and died at Brighton, England. His family lived at Stoke Newington, recollections of which appear in Poe's works.
J. H. Ingram dedicated himself to the resurrection of Poe's reputation, maligned by the dubious memoirs of Rufus Wilmot Griswold; he published the first reliable biography of the author and a four volume collection of his works.
Sarah Helen Whitman's correspondence with Ingram, with her letters from Poe and a daguerrotype portrait, was added to the library of material he was assembling; Ingram's Poe collection is now held at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia.
