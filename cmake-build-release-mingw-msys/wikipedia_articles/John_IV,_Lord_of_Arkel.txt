John IV, Lord of Arkel (also known as Jan Herbaren van Arkel; d. 5 May 1360) was Lord of Arkel from 1326 until his death.


== Life ==
He was the son of John III and his wife, Mabelia of Voorne.
Shortly after his father died, John IV became a councillor at the court of Count William IV of Holland.  When his half-brother John was elected Bishop of Utrecht, John IV withdrew from the court.  Nevertheless, his influence continued to grow as he acquired more territory.  This changed after William IV died during the Battle of Warns in 1345.  Tensions between the van Arkel and van Duivenvoorde families increased when William of Duivenvoorde obtained an influential position at the court of Countess Margaret of Holland.  John IV then joined the opposing side, which was led by Margaret's son William V.
He supported his half-brother with a loan when he later had a conflict with the Oversticht area.  He supported Duke Reginald III of Guelders during the siege of Tiel in 1350.  As the conflict between Margaret and William V escalated, John IV continued to support William V.  William enfeoffed the Lordships of Haastrecht and of the Lek to John IV.
He created an alliance with Gerard III van Heemskerk...
