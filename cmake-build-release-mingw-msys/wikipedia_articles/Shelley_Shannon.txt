Rachelle Ranae "Shelley" Shannon (born March 31, 1956) is an American anti-abortion extremist who was convicted in a Kansas state court for the attempted murder of George Tiller by shooting him in his car in Wichita, Kansas in 1993.  She was also convicted in U.S. federal court for ten attacks at abortion clinics using arson or acid.  At her sentencing in U.S. District Court in 1995, the presiding judge described Shannon as a terrorist and agreed with prosecutors that she was a threat even from behind bars.  She served her sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Waseca, Minnesota and was released in November 2018.


== Involvement in anti-abortion movement ==
Shannon became involved in the anti-abortion movement around 1988. She was arrested several times for trespassing and physically obstructing access to clinics.
After the murder of an abortion provider in Pensacola in 1993, Shannon wrote at least 25 letters to the perpetrator, calling him a "hero" and "brave soldier" and describing her disillusionment with nonviolence. She traveled to Kentucky to visit John Brockhoeft, convicted of firebombing a Cincinnati abortion clinic.
