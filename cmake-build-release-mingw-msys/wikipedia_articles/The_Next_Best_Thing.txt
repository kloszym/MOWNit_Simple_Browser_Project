The Next Best Thing is a 2000 American comedy drama film directed by John Schlesinger (his final feature film before his death in 2003) about two best friends who have a child together and a custody battle years after.

Its lead single, "American Pie", topped the charts in various countries, including Everett's native United Kingdom, and helped to introduce Don McLean's song to newer audiences.
