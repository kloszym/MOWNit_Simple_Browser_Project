The Rock Band series of music video games supports downloadable songs for the Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 versions through the consoles' respective online services. Users can download songs on a track-by-track basis, with many of the tracks also offered as part of a "song pack" or complete album at a discounted rate. All songs that are available to Rock Band 3 are playable in Rock Band Blitz.
Harmonix previously announced in February 2013 that it would stop regularly releasing new DLC songs for the Rock Band series after April 2, 2013, in order to focus on other projects, ending over 280 consecutive weeks of weekly releases dating back to 2007. On January 12, 2015, Harmonix announced that it would release three new DLC songs for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of Rock Band 3 on January 13, 2015, the first in nearly 21 months. The sudden release, along with a survey posted by Harmonix a few days later, hinted at the possibility of a new Rock Band game for eighth generation consoles.
Rock Band 4 was unveiled in March 2015, and released on October 6, 2015.
