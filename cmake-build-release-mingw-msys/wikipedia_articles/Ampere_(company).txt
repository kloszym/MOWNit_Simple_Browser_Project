Ampere is  an electric vehicle and software company formed in 2023 by Groupe Renault as part of the third phase of its "Renaulution" recovery plan. Renault originally planned to spin off Ampere and proceed with an IPO but canceled these plans in January 2024 but is operated as an autonomous business.

By developing Ampere as its own entity, Groupe Renault says it is creating "the first pure EV and software player born from an OEM disruption".
