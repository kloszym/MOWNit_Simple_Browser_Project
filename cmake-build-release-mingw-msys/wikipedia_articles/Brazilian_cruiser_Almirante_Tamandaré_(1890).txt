Almirante Tamandaré was a protected cruiser operated by the Brazilian Navy from 1897 to 1915. The construction of the cruiser was the result of Brazil's effort to develop a large steel ship, but the country had no experience with this type of ship, and the project resulted in an unreliable vessel.

The likely first trip would have been to Santa Catarina, still under rebel control. The second was in 1908, when it traveled to Bahia. On this trip, the crew was unable to control the vessel, leaving it adrift and subsequently...
