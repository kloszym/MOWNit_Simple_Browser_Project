== Overview ==
Taking place just after the end of the Bosnian War, the series is mostly set in the Halimić brothers owned kafana named Složna braća, located on a small patch of UN-controlled territory (covering 0.0675% of the country's territory, i.e. 564 m2) not claimed by any of the three warring sides. Serbs, Bosniaks, and Croats, otherwise very hostile to each other following a ferocious war, regularly visit the said kafana in no man's land in order to arrange mutual black market activities (weapons and food trade, oil and cigarette smuggling, etc.).
When the word gets around about an important weapons shipment passing through the territory that can supposedly completely change the division of power in the Balkans, the place becomes a lively hub of deal-making and skulduggery.
