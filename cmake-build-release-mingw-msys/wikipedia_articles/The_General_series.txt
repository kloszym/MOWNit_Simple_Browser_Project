The General (also known as the Raj Whitehall series, after the lead character) is a set of military science fiction books written by S. M. Stirling from an outline by David Drake.
Inspired by the Byzantine commander Belisarius, the series shares numerous common elements with the more recent Belisarius series by Drake and Eric Flint.
