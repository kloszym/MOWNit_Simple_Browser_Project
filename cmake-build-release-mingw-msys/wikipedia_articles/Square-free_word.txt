In combinatorics, a square-free word is a word (a sequence of symbols) that does not contain any squares. A square is a word of the form XX, where X is not empty. Thus, a square-free word can also be defined as a word that avoids the pattern XX.

=== Binary alphabet ===
Over a binary alphabet 
  
    
      
        {
        0
        ,
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{0,1\}}
  
, the only square-free words are the empty word 
  
    
      
        Ïµ
        ,
        0
        ,
        1
        ,
        01
        ,
        10
        ,
        010
      
    
    {\displaystyle \epsilon ,0,1,01,10,010}
  
, and 
  
    
      
        101
      
    
    {\displaystyle 101}
  
.


=== Ternary alphabet ===
Over a ternary alphabet 
  
    
      
        {
        0
        ,
        1
        ,
        2
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{0,1,2\}}
  
, there are infinitely many square-free words. It is possible to count the number 
  
    
      
        c
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c(n)}
  
 of ternary square-free words of length n.

This number is bounded by 
  
    
      
        c...
