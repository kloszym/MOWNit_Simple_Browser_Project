Fortnite is a free-to-play video game platform developed by Epic Games. Fortnite originally was developed as the cooperative player-versus-environment survival game, Fortnite: Save the World, released in July 2017. The game's developed shifted significantly following the beta release of the Fortnite Battle Royale in September 2017, a battle royale game where 100 players compete to be the last player standing after dropping from an airborne Battle Bus onto an island featuring several points of interests (POIs), a wide spread of various weapons and gear, and a harmful storm front that periodically shrinks in size to draw players into smaller areas on the island. This new mode drew numerous players to the game. With Fortnite Battle Royale's success, Epic expanded the Fortnite platform for other games and user-created modes built atop the Unreal Engine and Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) system. By 2025, Fortnite supports the Epic-developed Fortnite Battle Royale, Fortnite: Save the World, Lego Fortnite, Fortnite Festival, Rocket Racing, and Fortnite Ballistic, along with user-created games in Fortnite Creative and Fall Guys.
