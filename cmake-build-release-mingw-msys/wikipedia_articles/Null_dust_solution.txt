In mathematical physics, a null dust solution (sometimes called a null fluid) is a Lorentzian manifold in which the Einstein tensor is null.  Such a spacetime can be interpreted as an exact solution of Einstein's field equation, in which the only mass–energy present in the spacetime is due to some kind of massless radiation.


== Mathematical definition ==
By definition, the Einstein tensor of a null dust solution has the form

  
    
      
        
          G
          
            a
            b
          
        
        =
        8
        π
        Φ
        
        
          k
          
            a
          
        
        
        
          k
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle G^{ab}=8\pi \Phi \,k^{a}\,k^{b}}
  

where 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              k
              →
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\vec {k}}}
  
 is a null vector field.  This definition makes sense purely geometrically, but if we place a stress–energy tensor on our spacetime of the form

  
    
      
        
          T
          
            a
            b
          
        
        =...
