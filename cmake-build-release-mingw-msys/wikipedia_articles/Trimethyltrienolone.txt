Trimethyltrienolone (TMT), also known by its developmental code name R-2956 or RU-2956, is an antiandrogen medication which was never introduced for medical use but has been used in scientific research.


== Side effects ==
Due to its close relation to metribolone (methyltrienolone), it is thought that TMT may produce hepatotoxicity.


== Pharmacology ==


=== Pharmacodynamics ===
TMT is a selective and highly potent competitive antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR) with very low intrinsic/partial androgenic activity and no estrogenic, antiestrogenic, progestogenic, or antimineralocorticoid activity. The drug is a derivative of the extremely potent androgen/anabolic steroid metribolone (R-1881; 17α-methyltrenbolone), and has been reported to possess only about 4-fold lower affinity for the AR in comparison. In accordance, it has relatively high affinity for the AR among steroidal antiandrogens, and almost completely inhibits dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binding to the AR in vitro at a mere 10-fold molar excess. The AR weak partial agonistic activity of TMT is comparable to that of cyproterone acetate.
