Pemberton Music Festival was an annual four-day music festival that took place near Mount Currie in Pemberton, British Columbia.  Produced by Huka Entertainment, the 2016 event took place on  July 14â€“17.  The festival features multiple stages of live entertainment, including rock, indie rock, hip hop, electronic, heavy metal, and comedy.
On April 28, 2017, HUKA Entertainment announced the 2017 lineup.  It was to include Chance The Rapper, Muse, A Tribe Called Quest, Major Lazer, Run the Jewels, HAIM, Big Sean and others.
On May 18, 2017, it was announced the festival was cancelled and it had filed for bankruptcy.  Ernst & Young were appointed as the 'Trustee in Bankruptcy'.  Rising costs from the lower Canadian dollar and ticket sales were factors in the decision to file. Ticket holders and creditors were not expected to get a full refund or payment.  They will be creditors in the bankruptcy.
