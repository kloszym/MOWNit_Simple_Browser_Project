The 370th Flight Test Squadron is an active  United States Air Force unit assigned to the 413th Flight Test Group, stationed at Edwards Air Force Base, California.  It has been active in the flight test role since 2001.
The squadron was first activated in April 1942 as the 370th Bombardment Squadron, one of the original four squadrons of the 307th Bombardment Group.  After training in the United States, it deployed to the Pacific, serving mainly in the Southwest Pacific Theater.  The squadron earned two Distinguished Unit Citations for its actions in combat.  Following V-J Day, it returned to the United States for inactivation.
The squadron was reactivated as a Strategic Air Command (SAC) bomber squadron in 1946.  During the Korean War, it deployed to Okinawa and engaged in combat missions under the control of Far East Air Forces.  Following the end of hostilities in Korea, it returned to the United States, converting to Boeing B-47 Stratojets.  It flew the Stratojet until it was inactivated in 1965 as that plane was withdrawn from the SAC inventory.
