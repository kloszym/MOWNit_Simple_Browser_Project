The Theatre of Nations, also known as the State Theatre of Nations (Russian: Госуда́рственный теа́тр на́ций), is a theatre located in the heritage-listed building originally built in 1885 as the Korsh Theatre in central Moscow, Russia. The theatre has no resident acting company.

Several of its shows have toured the world over many years.
