Cape Freycinet is a point on the coast between Cape Leeuwin and Cape Naturaliste in the south west of Western Australia.
It is within the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River local government area, and the Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park.
It is not far from the Lake Cave and is approached from the Caves Road along Conto Road.
Named after the family of Freycinet, which had two brothers Henri Desaules and Louis de Freycinet – who were on the Baudin expedition.
The late Leslie Marchant in his posthumous publication on French names in Western Australia insists that it is not a cape, but a point – and names it Point Freycinet counter to the established name listed by Geoscience Australia database.
