Born in Hasselt, Belgium, Vaesen spent his first professional season at Belgian sides Cercle Brugge and K.S.C. Eendracht Aalst, and on 21 May 1998 moved to English side Huddersfield Town. He was sent off on his debut, but went on to play 135 league games. During his first season for the club, he won the club's Supporters' Player of the Year. After three years at Huddersfield, on 18 June 2001, he signed for Birmingham City.
He was given the first-choice goalkeeper role at Birmingham, helping the club win promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs in 2002. A memorable moment in the promotion season was saving a Gary Holt penalty in a 1â€“0 over Norwich City. Birmingham would go on to meet Norwich again in the play-off final and this time Vaesen saved from Philip Mulryne in the shootout. However a cruciate knee injury in March 2003 put him out of the game for nine months.
