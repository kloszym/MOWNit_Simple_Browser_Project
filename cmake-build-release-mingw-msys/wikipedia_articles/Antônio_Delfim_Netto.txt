Antônio Delfim Netto (Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation: [ɐ̃ˈtoniu dɛwˈfĩ ˈnɛtu]; 1 May 1928 – 12 August 2024) was a Brazilian economist, academic, and politician who was the Minister of Finance, Agriculture, and Planning, as well as a congressman. During his incumbency as Minister of Finance of Brazil, the country experienced the so-called Economic Miracle, a time of unprecedented economic growth.
The Milagre Econômico overseen by Delfim Netto relied on a heterodox, developmentalist model.  The economic expansion relied on low wages, rapidly rising exports, and foreign capital inflows. Delfim Netto gave another added meaning to the phrase "cake theory" in reference to this model: the cake had to grow before it could be distributed. Although the "cake" in his metaphor did grow, it was highly unequally distributed. Delfim Netto died in São Paulo on 12 August 2024, at the age of 96.
