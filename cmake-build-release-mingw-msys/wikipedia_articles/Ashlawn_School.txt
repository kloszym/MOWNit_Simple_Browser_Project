Ashlawn School (or simply Ashlawn), is a large partially selective secondary school located in the Hillmorton area of Rugby, Warwickshire, England that specialises in science, computing and leadership. It is one of only five bilateral schools in England for students aged 11â€“18. Ashlawn is a member of the Transforming Lives Educational Trust (TLET) family of schools.
Ashlawn School was formerly a National Teaching School. It was granted this status in October 2014. These schools were judged to be 'outstanding' by Ofsted. This function has since transferred to the Transforming Lives Educational Trust's Education Improvement Service, who offer Initial Teacher Education for trainee teachers.
In both November 2007 and November 2013, the school was awarded an Ofsted Outstanding rating (the highest rating). Siobhan Evans took over as Principal in January 2019 and inspectors visited again four years later in November 2022. This report awarded the school an Ofsted Inadequate rating (the lowest possible rating).
Ashlawn's 2022 report placed the number of pupils at 1,827, with 398 of those being students in the sixth form.
