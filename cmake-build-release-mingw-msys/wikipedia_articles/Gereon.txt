Gereon of Cologne (French: Géréon), who may have been a soldier, was martyred at Cologne by beheading, probably in the early 4th century.


== History ==
The Roman Martyrology states that "In Cologne in Germany, the Saints Gereon and his companions, martyrs, who with sincere piety, courageously offered their necks to the sword." That brief outline is the official account of the church, that is, the martyrdom by beheading, in the famous German city, of a group of Christians headed by a certain Gereon. In fact, nothing more can be said about them with historical certainty. 


== Legend ==
According to his legend, Gereon (called the "Golden Saint") was said to be a soldier of the Theban Legion.  Gregory of Tours, writing in the 6th century, said that Gereon and his companions were a detachment of fifty men of the Theban Legion who were massacred at Agaunum by order of Emperor Maximian for refusing to sacrifice to pagan gods to obtain victory in battle.
Some of his companions' names are stated as being Cassius, Gregorius Maurus, Florentius, Innocentius (Innocent), Constantinus, and Victor.
Bede the Venerable mentions that their feast was included in the Sarum calendar, as well as the calendars...
