The delicate prinia (Prinia lepida) is a small warbler. This prinia is a resident breeder in southern Asia, from Turkey to North India.
There are 5 subspecies, of which  P. g. akyildizi, of southern Turkey is the darkest, brownest, and most heavily streaked above, and has the brightest buff flanks.

A study published in 2021 concludes that the delicate prinia should be split from the graceful prinia.

Prinia lepida carpenteri, N Oman,
Prinia lepida lepida, SE Iran, S Afghanistan, Pakistan, N India, C Nepal,
