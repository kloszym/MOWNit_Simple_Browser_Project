Core plugs, welch plugs, or freeze plugs are used to fill the sand casting core holes found on water-cooled internal combustion engines,


== Purpose ==
Sand cores are used to form the internal cavities when the engine block or cylinder head(s) are cast. These cavities are usually the coolant passages. Holes are designed into the casting to support internal sand forms and to facilitate the removal of the sand after the casting has cooled. These holes generally have no factory designed purpose after the sand has been removed although some aftermarket temperature sensors may be installed into the location of a core plug on some engine designs. Another use is to install an aftermarket system designed to act as a block heater which is installed to keep an engine warm due to sub-freezing temperatures as found in far northern climates such as in Scandinavia, Canada, or the state of Alaska. One of the purposes of core plugs is to serve as a cap at the end of these passages used to prevent water or a coolant mixture from leaking out of the engine. Core plugs can also sometimes prevent freeze damage to the motor. During the early stages of the freezing of the engine coolant a freeze plug will...
