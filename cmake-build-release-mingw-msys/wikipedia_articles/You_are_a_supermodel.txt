You are a supermodel (Russian: "Ты - супермодель") was a Russian reality show on the STS TV channel, in which aspiring models vied for a contract with international modeling agency worth 250,000 dollars. The anchor of the show for the first two cycles was Fyodor Bondarchuk. Then Alexander Tsekalo took over for cycle 3. The host of the fourth cycle was Bondarchuk's wife, popular presenter Svetlana Bondarchuk.
The first cycle was held in 2004 and was won by 17-year-old Ksenia Kahnovich who refused the first prize, which was a contract with NEXT model management because she had already received a more lucrative offer by that time. Since the time of her victory, Kahnovich has become a very successful model, having walked in fashion shows for big names such as Versace, Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Dolce and Gabbana in New York, Paris and Milan.
Cycle two was held exactly one year after the first one and saw victory for Svetlana Sergienko, who was asked by Russian president Vladimir Putin to join the parliament as a representative for the growing modeling industry in Russia.
The show was discontinued after four cycles and returned under the name Top Model po-russki on Muz-TV in 2011...
