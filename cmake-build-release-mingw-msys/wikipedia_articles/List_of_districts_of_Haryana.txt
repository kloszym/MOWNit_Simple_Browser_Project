Haryana, with 22 districts, is a state in the northern region of India and is the nation's eighteenth most populous. The state borders with Punjab and Himachal Pradesh to the north and Rajasthan to the west and south. The river Yamuna defines its eastern border with  Uttar Pradesh. Haryana also surrounds Delhi on three sides, forming the northern, western and southern borders of Delhi. Consequently, a large area of Haryana is included in the National Capital Region. Chandigarh is the capital of Punjab and Haryana jointly.


== History ==
On 1 November 1966 Haryana was constituted as a separate state with seven districts, according to the partition plan of the then East Punjab. The seven districts were Rohtak, Jind, Hisar, Mahendragarh, Gurgaon, Karnal, Ambala. The partition was based on the linguistic demographics and was held after the recommendation of Sardar Hukam Singh—the then Speaker of the Lok Sabha—Parliamentary Committee. A further 15 districts were added later by re-organizing the erstwhile districts. The First Chief minister of Haryana was Pt. Bhagwat Dayal Sharma.
In 2016, Charkhi Dadri district was carved out of the larger Bhiwani.
