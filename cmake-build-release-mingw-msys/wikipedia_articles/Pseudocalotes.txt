Pseudocalotes is a genus of lizards in the family Agamidae. The genus is endemic to Southeast Asia.


== Taxonomy and description ==
Pseudocalotes was disassociated from the genus Calotes by Scott Michael Moody in 1980. Pseudocalotes is distinguished from Calotes in having weak limbs, as may be noted in one of the species named brevipes. It is distinguished from the C. versicolor group in having mixed orientation of dorsal scales, and lacking spines on the head. It is distinguished from Bronchocela in lacking a cheek skin fold, and in having short weak limbs. Pseudocalotes species do not have any enlarged compressed set of scales behind the orbit.


== Geographic range ==
Pseudocalotes does not occur west of Sumatra and may occur in the Isthmus of Kra and Myanmar. A specimen was reported from northeastern India in the past though never verified.
