"Space Age Love Song" is a 1982 single released by the British band A Flock of Seagulls. It was their fourth single. Lead guitarist Paul Reynolds remarked on their 1984 video album Through the Looking Glass that, as the band could not come up with a title for the track, he suggested "Space Age Love Song" because he thought it sounded like a space age love song.  The song reached the top 40 in the UK and the US in June 1982 and February 1983 respectively. The music video was directed by Tony van den Ende at Danceteria NY City.

Lead singer Mike Score has said of the song's meaning, "'Space Age' was just about intimacy, if you'd like. When you meet somebody there is an instant eye contact if the chemistry is right. If everything is right, you catch their eye... that whole 'across the crowded room/caught your eye' thing. The lyrics explain that: 'I saw your eyes and you made me smile.'"
A music video of the song was produced in 1982 and featured the band miming a performance of the song. The 1982 music video also took place on top of the Danceteria nightclub in New York City. The band made another video in 2018 to coincide with the release of Ascension.
