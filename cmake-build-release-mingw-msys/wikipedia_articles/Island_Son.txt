Island Son is an American medical drama television series that aired on CBS from September 16, 1989 to March 15, 1990, during the 1989â€“90 schedule.
Island Son marked the return of Richard Chamberlain to a regular TV series since his Dr. Kildare series almost 25 years earlier. In the interim, he had enjoyed a successful career in feature films and TV miniseries, and had become widely known as "The King of the Miniseries" due to his popularity in the latter.


== Premise ==
Chamberlain once again portrayed a dedicated medical doctor, Dr. Daniel Kulani. Kulani was born in Hawaii and practiced on the mainland for many years prior to his return to work at the fictional Kamehameha Medical Center in Honolulu. Kulani's complicated life involved his stressful work environment; his adoptive parents, Tutu and Nana; his 18-year-old son, Sam; and his love interest, high school drama teacher Nina Delaney. Dr. Kulani's complicated life had not been resolved to the satisfaction of viewers when the series was cancelled.
