Hans Leygraf (7 September 1920 – 12 February 2011) was a Swedish pianist, music educator, conductor and composer. 


== Life ==
Born in Stockholm, Leygraf studied piano with Gottfrid Boon in Stockholm and Anna Hirzel-Langenhan in Switzerland. He was one of Sweden's most internationally renowned musicians and also a famous educator. He taught at  Edsbergs musical institute outside Stockholm, in Darmstadt, Hanover, Berlin and Salzburg. In Salzburg he was professor of piano at the Mozarteum between 1972 and 1990,  but continued until 2007 to give lessons for particularly talented students. He gave concerts back in 2010 (80 years after his debut) and was probably best known for his interpretations of Mozart and Schubert.
As a composer, Leygraf was a member of The Monday Group, but he stopped composing as early as the 1940s.
Leygrat died in Stockholm at the age of 90.
