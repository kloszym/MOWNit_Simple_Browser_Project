Richard L. Greene (born 1938) is an American physicist. He is a distinguished university professor of Physics at the University of Maryland. Greene is known for his experimental research related to novel superconducting and magnetic materials.


== Career ==
Greene served in the Navy at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard where he was an officer in charge of the construction of the USS Halsey (DLG 23). He was awarded a PhD at Stanford University, where he and his collaborators discovered the first optical signatures of spin waves in insulating antiferromagnetic materials. As a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford he and his collaborators invented the thermal relaxation method for measuring the specific heat of small samples, a technique now widely used commercially in the Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System. In 1970 he became a staff member (and later a group manager) at the IBM Research Laboratory in San Jose, CA where he and collaborators discovered the first known polymeric and two-dimensional organic superconductors. In 1989 he became a physics professor and founding director of the Center for Superconductivity Research at the University of Maryland in College Park.  His...
