The 1948 United States presidential election in Nebraska took place on November 2, 1948, as part of the 1948 United States presidential election. Voters chose six representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Nebraska was won by Governor Thomas E. Dewey (R–New York), running with Governor Earl Warren, with 54.15% of the popular vote, against incumbent President Harry S. Truman (D–Missouri), running with Senator Alben W. Barkley, with 45.85% of the popular vote. As of the 2020 presidential election, this is the last occasion Wheeler County has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate.
Dewey won Nebraska by an 8.3% margin, a significantly reduced margin from his 1944 run, when he won by 17.2%.

Johnson's narrow victory in 1964. This was the only election between 1900 and 1992 in which Nebraska voted differently than neighboring Colorado.
