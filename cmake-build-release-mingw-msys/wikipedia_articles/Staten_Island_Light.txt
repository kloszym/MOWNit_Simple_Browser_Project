The Staten Island Range Light, also known as the Ambrose Channel Range Light, is the rear range light companion to the West Bank Lighthouse. Built in 1912, the 90-foot tower sits more than five miles northwest of the West Bank Lighthouse, on Staten Islandâ€™s Richmond Hill (Lighthouse Hill), 141 feet above sea level.  It shows a fixed white light that can be seen for 18 miles, by all vessels bound to New York and New Jersey Ports coming in from the Atlantic Ocean (on range only).
The original hardware, including the  second magnitude Fresnel lens and glass reflector, remain in place.  However, the original mineral oil-burning lamp has since been replaced  with a 1000 watt General Electric-manufactured Airway Signal incandescent lamp, with the backup light, which automatically turns on in the event of primary lamp failure,  being the same. Many lighthouses have transitioned to LED systems, but this legacy equipment remains in use at this light.
The Staten Island Range Light also has a second light, the Swash Channel Rear Light. This light is also a steady white light beacon, and shines continuously 24 hours a day. The Swash Channel is not a major shipping lane like the Ambrose Channel...
