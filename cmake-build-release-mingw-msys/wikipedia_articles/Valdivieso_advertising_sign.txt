The Valdivieso advertising sign (Spanish: letrero publicitario de Valdivieso) is a rooftop outdoor advertisement at 93 General Bustamante Street, Santiago, Chile. Erected around 1954, it was declared a National Monument of Chile on May 31, 2010.
The neon sign turns on at 9:00 PM during the summer and at 6:00 PM during the winter.


== History ==
The Valdivieso advertising sign was built in 1955 by the Luminosos Parragué company. General manager Claudio Parragué stated:"The companies wanted their products to portray a sort of 'magic.' That's why we used a mechanical electromagnetic system that, in time, ended up transforming the champagne bottle into a classic icon."
