Big Rooster (PNG) Ltd. is a Papua New Guinean fast food chain with 30 locations. Its specialty is barbecue chicken and fried chicken. Big Rooster has its roots in the Australian state of Queensland, where Nick Tana started the chain in the mid-1970s. It became a family-favourite in the 80s and was the second-largest chicken chain in the country. However, Big Rooster's Australian locations were all bought out by Coles Myer, owner of competitor Red Rooster, in 1986 and 1992. They were rebranded into Red Roosters, with only Papua New Guinean branches surviving.
