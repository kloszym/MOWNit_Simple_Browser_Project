The Sanctuaire de la Fontaine (English: Sanctuary of the Fountain) is an ancient site in the city of Nîmes, France. A probable place of worship of the first human settlement around the source, this site is located today in the heart of the Jardins de la Fontaine.

At the site of the original spring on which the city was founded, the fountain had a central role, since as a site of worship for the god  Nemausus. Shortly before the beginning of our era, an altar was set dedicated to the worship of Augustus. As time went by, a veritable sanctuary dedicated to the imperial cult was set up around the fountain.
In this "Augusteum" in addition to this emperor's altar arranged in the center of a nymphaeum, a theater, and a curious vaulted building called the “Temple of Diana”. It is not known whether this really is a temple, as there are indications that it is a library. Many hypotheses have been made about this building, but none have been proven true.
