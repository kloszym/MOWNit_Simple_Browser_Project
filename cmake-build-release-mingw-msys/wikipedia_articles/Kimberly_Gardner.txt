Kimberly M. Gardner (born August 2, 1975) is an American politician and attorney from the state of Missouri. She was the circuit attorney for the city of St. Louis, Missouri. She previously served as a member of the Missouri House of Representatives.
In February 2023, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey requested that Gardner resign after a serial criminal who had violated house arrest 51 times caused a teenage girl to lose both of her legs. In July 2022, the suspect in question had been in court, ready to be tried as a suspect of an armed robbery that had happened in 2020, but Gardner's office was not prepared for the trial, so Gardner's staff dismissed the charges and refiled them the same day. After the incident, several members of the Board of Aldermen also asked for Gardner to resign, and St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones stated that Gardner "needs to do some soul searching on whether or not she wants to continue with circuit attorney because she's lost the trust of the people".
On May 4, 2023, Gardner officially resigned as Circuit Attorney of St. Louis.  She announced her resignation would be effective June 1, but ended up stepping down early on May 16.
