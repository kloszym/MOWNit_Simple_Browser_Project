Spectrum Health Lakeland was a nonprofit community-owned health system in southwest Michigan. The health system comprised three hospitals, an outpatient surgery center, a regional cancer center, rehabilitation centers, two long-term care residences, home care and hospice services, and 34 affiliate physician practice locations. Following the Beaumont Health and Spectrum Health merger in 2022, Corewell Health was created and Spectrum Health Lakeland was merged into it.
