The Saxon Class XX HV were German eight-coupled express train, tender locomotives built for the Royal Saxon State Railways (Königlich Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen) just after the First World War. The locomotives, which became known as the 'Pride of Saxony' (Sachsenstolz) were the first and only German express locomotives with a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement and, at the time of their appearance, were the largest express engines in the whole of Europe. In 1925, the Deutsche Reichsbahn grouped these locomotive into their DRG Class 19.0.


== History ==
The XX HVs  were the last Saxon express train locomotives and were the pinnacle of Saxon locomotive engineering. They were conceived primarily for heavy express train duties on the winding and hilly Dresden to Hof trunk route through the Mittelgebirge.
Its design was related to the simultaneously developed 4-6-2 express locomotive Saxon XVIII H, but unlike the latter, it had a fourth coupled axle and a four-cylinder compound engine. Between 1918 and 1925 a total of 23 examples were manufactured by the Sächsische Maschinenfabrik in Chemnitz.
The locomotives were given new running numbers 19 001–023 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft in 1925...
