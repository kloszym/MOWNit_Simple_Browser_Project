== History ==
The Charles Dietle House was designed by architect Henry Geilfuss in 1878, for German-born custom boot maker Charles Dietle. After the 1906 earthquake and fire, the house was in relatively good condition and was sold to John DeMartini, a local fruit and veggie commission merchant and a director of the Bank of Italy (which later became Bank of America). 
The Charles Dietle House is five bedrooms, three and a half bathrooms with a roof deck, and is 6,950 square feet (646 m2). It features period details, including a winding main staircase, ornate fireplace mantles, built-in hutches, a dumbwaiter, and a basement ballroom. The building was once used as office space, and has been used as residential since around 2013.
