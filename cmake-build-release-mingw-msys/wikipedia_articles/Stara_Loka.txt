Stara Loka (pronounced [ˈstaːɾa ˈloːka]; German: Altlack) is a settlement in the Municipality of Škofja Loka in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia.
It is one of the oldest Slovene settlements first mentioned in documents concerning the lands Emperor Otto II granted to Bishop Abraham of Freising in the Duchy of Bavaria, dating to 973 AD. It was the original settlement of Loka and by 1286 it was already mentioned as Stara Loka (Old Loka).

The Saint George's Parish Church is also believed to have been one of the first churches in Carniola and is also one of the oldest parishes, first mentioned in 1074, when it covered the entire area of what is now Škofja Loka.
