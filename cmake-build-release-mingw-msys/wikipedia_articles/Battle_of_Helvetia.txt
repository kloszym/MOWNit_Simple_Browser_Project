The Battle of Helvetia was an engagement in the Second Boer War fought by Boer and British troops on 29 December 1900 in Helvetia 10 km north of Machadodorp, eastern South African Republic.


== Battle ==
Boer troops under Vechtgeneraal Chris Muller and overall command of General Ben Viljoen won a surprise victory over the British forces of Major Stapleton Lynch Cotton (1860-1928), attacking them from east and west at dark before daybreak. The Boers numbered about 580 men (or 350), while the British forces were only about 350 men strong, however boasting a 120mm (4.7 inch) naval cannon. Muller and his troops took 235 prisoners of war and the cannon. After burning British army stocks, Boer troops fled for oncoming British reinforcements.


== Aftermath ==
Muller later became particularly famous for the capture of this cannon, jokingly called the 'Lady Roberts'. Major Cotton, 1st Battalion King's Liverpool Regiment, was convicted of quitting his post at Helvetia, but acquitted of neglect of good order and military discipline.
