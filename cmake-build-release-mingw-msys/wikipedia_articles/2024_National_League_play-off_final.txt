The 2024 National League play-off final, known as the Vanarama National League Promotion Final for sponsorship reasons, was an association football match played on 5 May 2024 at Wembley Stadium, London, between Bromley and Solihull Moors. 
The match determined the second and final team to gain promotion from the National League, the fifth tier of English football, to EFL League Two. The champions of the 2023–24 National League season gained automatic promotion to EFL League Two, while the teams placed from second to seventh took part in the play-offs; Barnet finished in second position while Solihull Moors finished in fifth position. Barnet and Altrincham were the losing semi-finalists, while FC Halifax Town had lost at the eliminator stage. Gateshead had been forced to withdraw from the play-offs due to being unable to meet the EFL's ground regulation rules.
This was the second National League play-off final (after the 2019 final) in which neither of the teams had played EFL football beforehand.
