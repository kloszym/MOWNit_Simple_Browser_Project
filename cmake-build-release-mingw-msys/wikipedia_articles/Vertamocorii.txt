The Vertamocorii (Gaulish: *WertamocorÄ«) were a Celtic people that lived in Cisalpine Gaul around Novara, in Eastern Piedmont (Italy).
The Vertamocorii are reported by Pliny in the third book of Naturalis Historia, where they are said to be the founders of the city of Novara:

Novara (founded) by the Vertamocorii, that are from the Vocontii, and not, as believed Cato, Ligurians, ...
and indicates their Gaulish origin (the Vocontii were a people of Gallia Narbonensis) and not Ligurian.
