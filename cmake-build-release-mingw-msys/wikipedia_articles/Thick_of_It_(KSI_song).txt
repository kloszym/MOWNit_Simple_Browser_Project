"Thick of It" is a song by English Internet personality and musician KSI featuring American rapper and singer Trippie Redd. This is the second collaboration between the two following "Wake Up Call". "Thick of It" was released for digital download and streaming via Warner Music Group and Atlantic Records on 3 October 2024 alongside the song "Low". "Thick Of It" combines trap music with emo pop and pop rap and was inspired by the recent backlash towards KSI, his product Lunchly, and their controversies.
The song received overwhelming mockery from audiences and heavy negative criticism following the Lunchly controversy, but was still a commercial success, reaching number 6 on the UK Singles Chart and number 64 on the US Billboard Hot 100. A remix featuring fellow American rapper NLE Choppa was later released on 1 November 2024, Choppa's 22nd birthday. "Thick of It" was nominated for Song of the Year at the Brit Awards 2025.
