Equine lymphangitis  is an inflammation or swelling associated with impairment of the lymphatic system, particularly in a limb, in horses. It is most commonly a bacterial infection, although bacterial culture may be negative.
Often referred to as fat- or big-leg disease, it is sometimes known as weed or Monday-morning disease (not to be confused with the more common usage of MMD referring to exertional rhabdomyolysis or azoturia).
This article refers mainly to sporadic lymphangitis. Ulcerative lymphangitis is referred to in passing, as it is managed in a similar manner. Epizootic lymphangitis is similar to glanders, but caused by the fungus Histoplasma farciminosum.

Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis has been cultured from some cases (particularly of ulcerative lymphangitis, but in others, a bacterial culture is negative. This may be because:

a) The micro-organism responsible is difficult to culture (e.g. many Mycoplasma species).
b) The organism has been effectively eliminated by the immune system and the pathology is due to an excessive immune response after the organism has been cleared.
c) The organism is not a bacterium, but a fungus, so is very difficult to culture...
