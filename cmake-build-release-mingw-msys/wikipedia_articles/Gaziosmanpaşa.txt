== History ==
The district was named after Gazi Osman Pasha (1832–1900), a prominent Ottoman general who was active in the Balkans. The area was empty, rocky pasture until the 1950s when immigrants from the Balkans (especially from Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Western Thrace) settled here. Much of their housing was illegally built, primitive tiny cottages. Gaziosmanpaşa expanded rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s due to migration from eastern Anatolia. The population is still growing with half the people under 20 years old. 
Gaziosmanpaşa was formed as a district in 1963 from parts of Eyüp and Çatalca districts. In 2009 Gaziosmanpaşa district was divided into three neighborhoods: Gaziosmanpaşa, the central; Sultangazi, the northern part; and Arnavutköy, the northernmost part.
