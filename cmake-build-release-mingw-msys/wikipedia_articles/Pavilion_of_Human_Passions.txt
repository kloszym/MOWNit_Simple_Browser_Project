The Pavilion of Human Passions (French: Pavillon des Passions humaines; Dutch: Paviljoen der Menselijke Driften), also known as the Horta-Lambeaux Pavilion, is a neoclassical pavilion in the form of a Greek temple that was built by Victor Horta in 1896 in the Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark of Brussels, Belgium.

Since its completion, the building has remained almost permanently closed. Since 2014, it is accessible during the summer time.
