Scotland's Gardens is a horticultural charity established in 1931 and based in Edinburgh. It was founded to raise money for the Queen's Nursing Institute Scotland, to help support the Queen's Nurses, before the creation of the National Health Service. It now raises money for other charities by opening otherwise private gardens throughout the country to the general public. The criteria to have your garden listed in the "Yellow Book" are tough, and it is considered a challenge to achieve a listing.
40% of the funds raised are given to charities selected by the owners of the gardens. Over 200 charities benefit every year. The other 60% of funds are given to four charities selected by Scotland's Gardens:

Queen's Nursing Institute Scotland
the Gardens Fund of the National Trust for Scotland
Maggie's Cancer Caring Centres
Perennial
