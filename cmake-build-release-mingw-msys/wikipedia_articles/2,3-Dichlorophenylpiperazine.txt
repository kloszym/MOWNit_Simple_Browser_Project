2,3-Dichlorophenylpiperazine (2,3-DCPP or DCPP) is a chemical compound from the phenylpiperazine family. It is both a precursor in the synthesis of aripiprazole and one of its metabolites. It is unclear whether 2,3-DCPP is pharmacologically active as a serotonin receptor agonist similar to its close analogue 3-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), though it has been shown to act as a partial agonist of the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors.


== Legality ==
2,3-DCPP has been made illegal in Japan and Hungary after having been identified in seized designer drug samples.

== Positional Isomer ==

The positional isomer 3,4-dichlorophenylpiperazine (3,4-DCPP) is also known, and acts as both a serotonin releaser via the serotonin transporter, and a β1-adrenergic receptor blocker, though with relatively low affinity at both targets.
