Mitchell Franklin "Mitch" Jayne (July 5, 1928 – August 2, 2010) was an American musician, best known as emcee and upright bass player in The Dillards bluegrass band, the band often remembered for their several Andy Griffith Show appearances as the Darling Family, 1963–1966, as well as touring throughout southern California in the late 1960s. 
Jayne was an author, musician, and storyteller. Several tunes which he co-wrote with The Dillards are now considered bluegrass classics. Dooley; There is a Time; The Old Home Place, and The Whole World Round.  He also authored four books, Home Grown Stories & Home Fried Lies, The Forest in the Wind, Old Fish Hawk, and Fiddler's Ghost. Jayne had almost finished another novel, Glory Hole War, prior to his death at age 82, with only one chapter left unwritten. He narrated the ending to his editor during the last two weeks of his life so that the book could be released.
