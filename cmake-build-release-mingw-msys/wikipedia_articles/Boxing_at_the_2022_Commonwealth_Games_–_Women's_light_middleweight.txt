The Women's light middleweight boxing competitions at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England took place between July 30 and August 7 at National Exhibition Centre Hall 4. Light middleweights were limited to those boxers weighing between 66 and 70 kilograms.
Like all Commonwealth boxing events, the competition was a straight single-elimination tournament. Both semifinal losers were awarded bronze medals, so no boxers competed again after their first loss. Bouts consisted of three rounds of three minutes each, with one-minute breaks between rounds.
