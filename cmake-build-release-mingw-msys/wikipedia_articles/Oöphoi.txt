Gianluigi Gasparetti (26 March 1958 – 12 April 2013), known by the pseudonym Oöphoi, was an Italian ambient musician. He is perhaps best known for his role as the editor of Deep Listenings, an Italian magazine dedicated to ambient and deep atmospheric music, where he has featured interviews with many famous ambient artists including Steve Roach and Michael Stearns. Oöphoi's music can be characterized as being static, organic and minimalistic. It has an overall solid and monolithic feel to it, often integrated in a meditative and spiritual context. Created by using synths, singing bowls, flutes, and processed voices, his recordings have relatively slight harmonic variations. Gianluigi Gasparetti died in 2013 after a long illness.
