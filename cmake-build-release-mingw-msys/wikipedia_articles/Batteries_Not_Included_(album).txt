Batteries Not Included is the fourth and final album of all-new material released by UK band After the Fire. The official release date was 19 March 1982, but some sources on the Internet claim a late 1981 release date (the first two singles from this album, Dancing in the Shadows and Frozen Rivers, were released in 1981).  "Dancing in the Shadows" would later become a minor U.S. hit, after it was featured on the band's lone American album release, ATF (which was released as Der Kommissar outside of the U.S.).
