The Nassau County Sewage District is a public sewer district in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. It is owned by Nassau County and as of 2022 is operated under contract by Suez North America.


== Description ==
The Nassau County Sewage District serves large portions of Nassau County.

In recent years, the Nassau County Sewage District assumed control of the City of Glen Cove's sanitary sewer system.
Nassau County's sanitary sewer system handles roughly 85% of sewage in Nassau County. The other 15% is handled by smaller, independent water pollution control districts (i.e.: the Port Washington Water Pollution Control District).
The Nassau County Sewage District also treats sanitary sewage from other, independent systems (i.e.: the Village of Roslyn's sanitary sewer system, which is treated by Nassau County's facilities via the line known as the East Hills Interceptor, which travels from Roslyn Heights to the main part of the Nassau County network in Westbury by means of Roslyn Road, the North Service Road, and Old Westbury Road).
