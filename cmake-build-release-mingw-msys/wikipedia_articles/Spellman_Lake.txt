Nontoxic shot is required for all shooting in the area.  The use of airboats on North and South Spellman Lakes is prohibited by law at all times.  A public water access is maintained on the north lake by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
Hunters should be careful not to shoot protected birds such as bald eagles and swans that frequent the area.
