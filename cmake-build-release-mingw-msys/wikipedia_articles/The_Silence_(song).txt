The song was written by Bilal Hajji and Savan Kotecha, along with the song's producer Nadir "RedOne" Khayat. The song was released as the sixth and final single off the album. Burke stated that the song was written when her aunt told the singer about how her partner and she were experiencing troubles in their relationship, and that they were not telling each other how they felt. In response, Burke asked her aunt why she was letting the silence in their relationship do the talking instead of them discussing it. "The Silence" is an R&B and pop-influenced power ballad and instrumentation consists of a piano, a guitar, and drums. The lyrics of the song feature the protagonist asking why the other person in the relationship remains silent about their difficulties instead of talking about them.
