"Bo Diddley" is a song by American rock and roll pioneer Bo Diddley. It introduced the rhythm that became known as the Bo Diddley beat and topped the Billboard R&B chart for two weeks in 1955. The song is included on many of Diddley's compilation albums including Bo Diddley (1958) and His Best (1997). Buddy Holly recorded a version that posthumously became his 2nd highest-charting single in the UK after "It Doesn't Matter Anymore". 


== Composition and recording ==
The song is rhythmically similar to hambone, a technique of dancing and slapping various parts of the body to create a rhythm and song. Diddley's electric guitar along with his backup musicians on maracas and drums contributed to the patted juba rhythm. This fusion of rock and roll, African rhythms, and guitar was a breakthrough and became known as the Bo Diddley Beat. Lyrically, it is similar to the traditional lullaby "Hush Little Baby".
"Bo Diddley" was recorded in Chicago at his first formal session for Leonard Chess on March 2, 1955.  Diddley, on guitar and vocals, was accompanied by Frank Kirkland on drums, Jerome Green on maracas, and Billy Boy Arnold on harmonica.
