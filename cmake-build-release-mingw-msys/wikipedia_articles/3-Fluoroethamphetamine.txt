3-Fluoroethamphetamine (3-FEA) is a stimulant drug of the amphetamine class which acts as a releasing agent of the monoamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin.
Compared to the unsubstituted ethylamphetamine, 3-fluoroethamphetamine is a weaker releaser of noradrenaline, but a stronger releaser of both dopamine and serotonin, and produced the strongest reinforcing effects in animal studies out of a range of 3-substituted ethamphetamine derivatives tested, despite not being the most potent dopamine releaser.
