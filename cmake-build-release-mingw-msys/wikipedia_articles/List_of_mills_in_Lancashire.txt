This is an incomplete list of the cotton and other textile mills that were located within the modern-day boundaries of the ceremonial county of Lancashire, England. The first mills were built in the 1760s, in Derbyshire using the Arkwright system and were powered by the water. When stationary steam engines were introduced they still needed water, so the mills were built along rivers and canals. As a broad rule of thumb, spinning mills were built in the south-east of the county, and weaving sheds to the north and west.  Parts of Lancashire have been subsumed into Greater Manchester and Merseyside, and are not included in this list. Parts of Yorkshire are now included in this county.
