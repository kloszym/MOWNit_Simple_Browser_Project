Fuse is a brand of chocolate bar manufactured by Cadbury in India since 2016. A different bar of the same name was produced in the United Kingdom between 1996 and 2006.


== British Fuse ==
The original British product was a 70% solid bar of milk chocolate, and 30%, sliced peanuts, raisins, crisp cereal and fudge pieces suspended within it. Fuse was Cadbury's fastest selling new chocolate bar since the launch of Cadbury ‘Wispa’ in 1983.  The bar tested very well in research, with 82% rating it as excellent or very good and 83% proposing to purchase it regularly.
Fuse was the subject of a large marketing campaign leading to a national rollout of the product on "FuseDay" - Tuesday 24 September 1996.
 The unusually large marketing campaign was the subject of a documentary by TV Choice Ltd - The Marketing Mix at Cadbury's (1998).
Forty million Fuse bars were sold in the first week of release.
In September 1999 Cadbury launched Miniature Heroes which were a response to rival Mars' Celebrations. Miniature Heroes contained miniature versions of various Cadbury chocolate bars including Fuse which was featured in the selection until being retired in 2004.
Fuse bars were discontinued in November...
