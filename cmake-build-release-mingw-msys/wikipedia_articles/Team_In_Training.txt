Team In Training (TNT) is the flagship fundraising program for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS), the world's largest voluntary health organization dedicated to funding blood cancer research, education and patient services. TNT is the only endurance sports training program where volunteers train to complete a marathon, half marathon, cycle event, triathlon or hike adventure, while fundraising to support the fight against blood cancers.
TNT participants train with experienced coaches who provide personalized workouts and clinics on nutrition, injury prevention and hydration. Coaches not only prepare participants prior to the event, but are at the event coaching along the course of the event ensuring every TNT participant crosses the finish line. 
Today's participants travel to destinations like New York City, Lake Tahoe, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Florida, Washington, D.C., and Hawaii.

In 1988, Bruce Cleland assembled a team to run the New York City Marathon and raise money in honor of his daughter, a leukemia survivor. This team of 38 runners raised $322,000 for The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's (LLS) work to discover new treatments for blood cancers.
