American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin is a biographical book about American missionary Minnie Vautrin and her experience of the Nanjing Massacre in 1937â€“1938. Written by historian Hua-ling Hu and published in 2000, the book recounts how Vautrin saved thousands of lives of women and children during the Nanjing Massacre.  A notable source for the book were the diaries that Vautrin kept during the massacre; these were discovered by author Iris Chang during the research for her book The Rape of Nanking.
