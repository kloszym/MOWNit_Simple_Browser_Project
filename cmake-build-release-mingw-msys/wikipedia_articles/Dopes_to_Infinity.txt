Dopes to Infinity is the third album by American rock band Monster Magnet, released on March 21, 1995. The album includes the song "Negasonic Teenage Warhead", the band's first hit single. 


== Overview ==
The song "Negasonic Teenage Warhead" became the band's first hit single, after having appeared the previous year in different form in the American movie S.F.W.. Other tracks, such as the title track and "Dead Christmas" however, received little or no airplay, resulting in sales of the album being only slightly better than their previous album, Superjudge. The album did reach #51 on the UK Charts and #30 in the German Charts.
A music video was made for the song "Negasonic Teenage Warhead," directed by Gore Verbinski.
In 2011, Monster Magnet revisited the album when they embarked on "Dopes To Infinity 2011: The European Tour", performing the album live in its entirety at several European locations.


== Reception ==

In 2005, Dopes to Infinity was ranked number 406 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time.
