Enchelycore is a genus of moray eels in the family Muraenidae. Enchelycore species are generally small to medium-sized eels, most ranging from 2 to 3 feet (61 to 91 cm) in length, with the largest being the Mosaic Moray (E. ramosa), which reaches a length of 6 feet (180 cm). Members of the genus feature distinctive, curved jaws that prevent them from fully closing their mouth and aids them in catching, and holding on to prey. Enchelycore species can also feature extremely bright colors (E. pardalis, E. anatina) and ornate markings (E. lichenosa).
