== Plot ==
As described in a film magazine review, Rex, a wild horse of the plains, courts The Lady, an aristocratic mare, but loses her when they wander into the valley ruled by Joe Pangle and his herd of horses. Pangle challenges Rex and defeats him in a fight.
Wounded and retreating, Rex stumbles into a stream and becomes trapped in quicksand. He is rescued by Jim Lawson, who pulls him free with his bare hands. That night, Rex repays the favor by driving off a pack of wolves that attack Lawson, and later, he fights a mountain lion to save the man's life.
Meanwhile, Jane Logan is pursued by Pangle, prompting Lawson to chase after them on horseback. When Lawson's horse is shot, Rex allows him to mount and continue the pursuit. As Lawson and Pangle engage in a brutal fight, Rex, inspired by the battle, attacks Pangle once more. Together, Lawson and Rex emerge victorious. In the end, The Lady returns to Rex, and Jane reunites with Lawson.
