Northwest Bakersfield (commonly referred to simply as The Northwest) is the northwest region of Bakersfield, California. It is bounded by the Kern River/Stockdale Highway to the south and State Route 99 to the east. The other boundaries are the city limits themselves.
Historically, this region was rural, with the farming communities of Fruitvale, Rosedale, and Greenacres. However, starting in the mid-1990s, this region started experiencing significant growth. The city limits have reached the boundaries of these communities.
The area incorporated by the city is primarily residential and retail, including some commercial. The area that is unincorporated is primarily industrial.

The development will be constructed in three phases and take approximately 20 years to complete. It will employ a building policy where residential, commercial, and retail spaces will be constructed closely together to allow for easy access by foot.
