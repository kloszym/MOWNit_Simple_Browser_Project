In 1997, "Hey Girl" was one of three cover songs Billy Joel included on his album Greatest Hits Volume III. In an interview for Billboard, Joel said of the song, "I recorded that song a few years ago. I had split up with Christie [Brinkley] and my daughter was going to live far away, and I was very sad. When I sang that song, that's who I was singing it to, my little girl."
