Hugh Wood (10 January 1736 - 24 January 1814) was a landowner of Derbyshire gentry, and ran collieries in the small village of Swanwick. Hugh Wood notably owned Swanwick Hall (a villa build by architect, Joseph Pickford) from 1772 onwards, and knew many important Derbyshire people at the time such as Joseph Wright, whom he was a patron of.


== Early life ==
Wood was born on 10th January 1736 to John and Martha Wood in Yellowâ€™s Yard, Swanwick. He was raised alongside his two brothers, John (the eldest child) and Richard (the middle child), and lived at the Wood family home, a locally styled farmhouse constructed in 1676 (some parts of the house theorised to have been built earlier), made of local stone. It is now 110, 112 and 114 Derby Road.
Hugh's brother, John, became vicar of Chesterfield in 1765 and the domestic chaplain to William Cavendish, the 5th Duke Of Devonshire, at his home in Chatsworth, whilst Richard died young in 1759.
This meant that Hugh took on the family coal  rights of the land surrounding, as well as management of several farms in the area.
