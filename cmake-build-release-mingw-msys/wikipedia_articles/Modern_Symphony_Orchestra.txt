The Modern Symphony Orchestra (sometimes called the Northern Polytechnic Modern Symphony Orchestra) was a London amateur orchestra that existed from 1931 to 1983.


== History ==
The Modern Symphony Orchestra was founded by Arthur Dennington, who led several smaller orchestral amateur ensembles in Northern London at that time and combined them in 1931 into a symphony orchestra. The name Modern Symphony Orchestra derived from the fact that the orchestra wanted to play "modern" music by contemporary and little known composers, and allow young soloists to perform with the orchestra.
The orchestra's first concert hall was Islington Town Hall. But owing to the poor acoustics there the orchestra moved to the Polytechnic Theatre in Holloway Road. In 1938 the Modern Symphony Orchestra was officially adopted by the Polytechnic Music Trades School and so became a part of the Northern Polytechnic Institute. Because of the terms of its charter the polytechnic was unable to subsidise the orchestra, but it provided rehearsal space and a theatre in which to perform.
In accordance with the name of the orchestra, contemporary, unknown or rarely heard compositions were performed regularly from the beginning...
