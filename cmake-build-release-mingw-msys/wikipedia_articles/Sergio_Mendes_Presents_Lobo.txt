== Reception ==

Billboard magazine reviewed the album in their April 24, 1971 issue and wrote that ""To Say Goodbye" and "Ponterio" are outstanding vocals".
Richard S. Ginnell reviewed the reissue of the album for Allmusic and wrote that the album "overflows with cunningly devised, first-class tunes" and that Lobo excelled at the use of "sharp scatted syllables" in place of lyrics on some of the songs. Ginnell highlighted Hermeto Pascoal's "playful and enigmatic electric piano and flute multiphonics" and the "multifaceted percussion talents" of Airto Moreira. Ginnell concluded that "Collectors of Brazilian jazz should seek this one out; it is absolutely essential".
