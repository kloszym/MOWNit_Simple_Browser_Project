== Description ==
St Ann's is an English country cottage designed in the Arts and Crafts style, with some Georgian revival influence, constructed from timber with a masonry foundation. It originally had 15 rooms, with five bedrooms on the first floor. It had a grand hallway, casement windows, and a Marseille tiled roof. The tall brick chimneys have an art deco-like motif. The entrance to the garden is reminiscent of the lych-gate of a rural church. An engine house and laundry were located south of the home. St Ann's sits amongst landscaped, parterre, and terraced gardens on a 3,062 m2 (3,662 sq yd) section. The façade faces towards the Waitematā Harbour instead of towards the street.
