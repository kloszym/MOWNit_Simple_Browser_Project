Flavin adenine dinucleotide synthetase 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the FLAD1 gene.


== Function ==
This gene encodes the enzyme that catalyzes adenylation of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) to form flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) coenzyme. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed.
