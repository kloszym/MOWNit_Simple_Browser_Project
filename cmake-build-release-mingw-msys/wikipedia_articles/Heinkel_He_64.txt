The Heinkel He 64 was a sports plane designed by the German aeronautical engineers Siegfried and Walter Günter and produced by the aircraft manufacturer Heinkel. It was specifically built to participate in the touring plane championships of 1933.
The He 64 was a sleek, low-wing monoplane of conventional configuration, being furnished with fixed, tailskid undercarriage and a well-furnished and relatively spacious cockpit. It was outfitted with a single-spar trapezoidal-shaped slotted folding wing; it was the first such wing of its type. The automated slots permitted the aircraft to fly at steep climb angles and relatively low landing speeds. Both the wing and fuselage were primarily composed of wood. A variety of engines could be fitted to power the He 64 including the de Havilland Gipsy III, Hirth HM 504A-2, Hirth HM 506, and Argus As 8R.
First flown in 1933, the type promptly entered several air races; notably, it took the first three places in the 7,363 km (4,601 mi) Europa Rundflug ("Rally over Europe"). While quickly overshadowed by other developments, the aircraft was used for testing purposes for a while. At least one aircraft was alleged still active into the early 1950s.
