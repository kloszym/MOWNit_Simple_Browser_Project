The Embassy of the United States in Libreville is the diplomatic mission of the United States of America in Gabon. The U.S. Ambassador to Gabon is also responsible for diplomatic relations with São Tomé and Príncipe.


== History ==
The United States recognized Gabon on August 17, 1960, on the day Gabon proclaimed independence from French Equatorial Africa. Diplomatic relations were established on the same date when Alan W. Lukens, who was resident at Brazzaville, presented his credentials as Chargé d'Affaires ad interim. The Embassy of the United States in Libreville was officially established on March 20, 1961, with Walker A. Diamanti serving as the Chargé d'Affaires ad interim. The embassy was bombed in two incidents in early March 1964, when the United States was mistakenly blamed for influencing the 1964 Gabonese coup d'état.
