The Latin American Center for Human Economy (Spanish: Centro Latinoamericano de Economía Humana, sometimes CLAEH) is a Uruguayan non-profit organization and university founded in 1957. Based in Montevideo, its doctrinal inspiration comes from the current of Economics and Humanism, promoted since the 1940s by the Breton Dominican priest Louis-Joseph Lebret on Économie et humanisme, which affirms the values of the human person, solidarity and commitment to social change at the service of development.
