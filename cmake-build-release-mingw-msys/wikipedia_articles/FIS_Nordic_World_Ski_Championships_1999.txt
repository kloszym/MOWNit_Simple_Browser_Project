The first two legs were run in the classical style while the last two legs were run in freestyle. Austria won its first relay medal since 1933 though it was done in dramatic fashion. Botvinov fell during his leg, causing Austria to lose its large lead, setting up a fight to the finish between Austria's Hoffmann and Norway's Alsgaard. As of 2025, this is the last men's relay at the world championships that was not won by Norway.
