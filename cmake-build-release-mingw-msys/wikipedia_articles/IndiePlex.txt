IndiePlex, stylized as indieplex since 2006, is an American premium television network which features independent motion pictures. It is a spinoff of MoviePlex and is owned by Starz Inc. The headquarters of IndiePlex and its sister channels MoviePlex and RetroPlex are located on the Meridian International Business Center complex in Meridian, Colorado.
On April 5, 2016, Starz was rebranded and added all the Encore channels to its moniker, therefore increasing the Starz channel lineup to 14 Starz movie channels. Its main channel was rebranded "Starz Encore" and carries reruns of Starz originals in addition to films.
On June 30, 2016, Lionsgate agreed to acquire Starz Inc. for $4.4 billion in cash and stock.
