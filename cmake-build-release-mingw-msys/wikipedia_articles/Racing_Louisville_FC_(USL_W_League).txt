Racing Louisville FC is an amateur women's soccer team that plays in the USL W League. It is affiliated and shares ownership with the eponymous professional team Racing Louisville FC, which competes in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL).


== History ==
In January 2022, NWSL club Racing Louisville FC added an amateur team to compete in the newly formed USL W League, becoming the first NWSL club to do so. This followed the club's academy opening in 2020 and completed its developmental pathway from youth soccer to top-division professional play. The club hired an all-female technical staff to lead the team, with Kincaid Schmidt as its inaugural head coach and former NWSL player Libby Stout as assistant coach.
In the 2023 USL W League season, Racing finished in a tie on points for first place in the Valley division with eventual national championship finalists Indy Eleven with a greater goal differential, but second due to the first tiebreaker being head-to-head record and did not advance to the conference playoffs. The team's only loss and draw on its 8–1–1 season record were against Indy.
