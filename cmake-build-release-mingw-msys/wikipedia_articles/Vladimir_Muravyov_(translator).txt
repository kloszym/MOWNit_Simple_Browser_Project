Vladimir Sergeyevich Muravyov (Russian: Влади́мир Серге́евич Муравьёв; February 12, 1939, in Vitebsk – June 10, 2001, in Moscow) was a Russian translator and literary critic. He was awarded the Inolit Prize for Best Translation in 1987 (The Great Pursuit by Tom Sharpe).
In 1976 Muravyov published a pioneering Russian article in the Soviet Union titled "Tolkien and Critics". Together with Andrey Kistyakovsky, he made the first official, though partial, Russian translation of The Lord of the Rings, published in 1982 with an introductory foreword. Muravyov continued the work after Kistyakovsky's death.
