Stephen Douglas Sturton, C.B.E., O.St.J., M.A., M.D. (1896 - 1970) was an English medical missionary. He worked in Hangzhou, China, formally referred to as Hangchow, and was the last of the Church Missionary Society's English missionaries to leave the country. Sturton was a missionary during China's war times, when he worked to protect his hospital, set up refugee camps, and worked on the front line to save the lives of thousands of badly wounded soldiers. He received medals for his work and at one point even treated General Chiang Kai-Shek. Eventually, Sturton was captured by the Japanese and taken to two concentration camps. After being freed he returned as president of the C.M.S. Hospital, now known as the Second Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine. He details his experiences up to being freed from Fengtai Camp in his book From Mission Hospital to Concentration Camp.
