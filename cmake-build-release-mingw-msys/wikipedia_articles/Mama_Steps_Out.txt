== Plot ==
After inheriting a fortune, the Cuppy family of Fort Wayne, Indiana go to France to "broaden" their cultural outlook, although father Leonard (Guy Kibbee), a perfume manufacturer, and daughter Leila (Betty Furness) are not as enthusiastic as mother Ada (Alice Brady). On the way to France, Leila sees Chuck Thompson (Dennis Morgan), a singer on board their ship, whom she used to know, but he refuses to return her enthusiastic attempts to start a romance. Hoping to change his mind, Leila convinces her parents to take a villa in Antibes, where Chuck is appearing with Ferdie Fisher's band. Meanwhile, Ada is bored with staying at the villa and only meeting Americans. When a local priest (Frank Puglia) comes asking for money to save his church, Ada asks him to introduce her to some "cultural" Europeans.
