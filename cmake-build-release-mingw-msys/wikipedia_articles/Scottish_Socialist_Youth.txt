Scottish Socialist Youth (SSY) is a non-partisan anti-capitalist organisation which stands for the creation of an independent, socialist Scotland. They regard their core principles as "Socialism, Independence, Social Liberation, Democracy, Internationalism and Environmentalism".
The organisation was previously known as the Young Scottish Socialists (YSS) from a period from 2015 to 2021. In 2021, the organisation was relaunched by ex-members as Scottish Socialist Youth, unaffiliated with the Scottish Socialist Party and as a non-partisan left-wing pressure group.
They have one University affiliate, that being Stirling University SSY.
