The 7.5 hull uses aft chines to add stability and make planing easier. The rig was developed with input from sailmaker Bob Pattison of Neil Pryde Sails and the spars were designed by CST Spars of Sydney, Australia.

The hull has a plumb stem with a retractable bowsprit, a slightly reverse transom, a removable transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a lifting keel with bulb weight...
