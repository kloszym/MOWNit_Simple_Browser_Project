Pyramid Peak is an 8,875-foot (2,705-meter) mountain summit located at the western edge of the Saint Elias Mountains, in the U.S. state of Alaska. The peak is situated in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, 22 mi (35 km) southeast of McCarthy, 7 mi (11 km) southeast of Williams Peak, and 6 mi (10 km) south-southeast of Joshua Green Peak. The peak's descriptive local name was reported in 1908 by the United States Geological Survey. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Nizina River, which in turn is part of the Copper River drainage basin.

Based on the Köppen climate classification, Pyramid Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and cool summers. Weather systems coming off the Gulf of Alaska are forced upwards by the Saint Elias Mountains (orographic lift), causing heavy precipitation in the form of rainfall and snowfall. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °F with wind chill factors below −30 °F. This climate supports small unnamed glaciers on its north and south slopes. The months May through June offer the most favorable weather for viewing and climbing.
