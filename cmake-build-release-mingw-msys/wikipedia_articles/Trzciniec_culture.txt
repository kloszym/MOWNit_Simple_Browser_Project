The Trzciniec culture is an Early and Middle Bronze Age (2400-1300 BC) archaeological culture in Central-Eastern Europe, mainly Poland and parts of Lithuania. The material culture similarity and overall chronological contemporaneity with Komarov (Ukraine) and Sośnica (Belarus) cultures resulted in the definition of the Trzciniec-Komaróv-Sośnica complex or, more recently, the Trzciniec Cultural Circle.
In Poland, the archaeological sites of the Trzciniec culture are found in Central, Southern, and Eastern Poland (Kuyavia, Lesser Poland, Mazovia, Podlachia, and Lublin Upland).


== History ==
Trzciniec culture was first identified by Włodzimierz Antoniewicz, who named it "band pottery culture".
The term "Trzciniec culture" from the eponymous site Trzciniec near Opole Lubelskie was introduced by Józef Kostrzewski in 1930.
The first complete monograph of the Trzciniec culture was written by Aleksander Gardawski.
From a cultural-historical perspective, the origins of the Trzciniec culture are associated with three Corded Ware-related cultures: Mierzanowice, Strzyżów and Iwno.
In general, the Trzciniec culture was succeeded by the Lusatian culture.
