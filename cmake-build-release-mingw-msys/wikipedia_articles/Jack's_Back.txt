== Plot ==
In Los Angeles, a young doctor named John Wesford becomes a suspect when a series of Jack the Ripper copycat killings is committed. John and another young doctor, Jack Pendler, are at the scene of the latest crime in the series; they know each other because they both work for the same medical unit, reporting to the abusive Dr. Sidney Tannerson. Pendler seems to realize that John's testimony will likely lead to his being arrested as the killer, and in an ambiguously staged scene, murders him, staging the scene to resemble a suicide. The police quickly name John as the copycat killer and hypothesize that he killed himself out of guilt...
