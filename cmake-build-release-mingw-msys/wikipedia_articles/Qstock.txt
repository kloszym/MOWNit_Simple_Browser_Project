Qstock is an annual two-day music festival held at the end of July in Oulu, Finland.
The festival lineup includes some of the biggest names in both the domestic and international music scene, regardless of the genre. The first Qstock festival was organised in 2003. The festival has quickly grown into the biggest summer event in northern Finland, with 40,000 visitors. As of July 2023, Qstock has been sold out nine times in a row. The festival acts as sort of a successor of the former Kuusrock festival which was organised in Oulu from the 1970s until the early 1990s.
Qstock is owned by local ice hockey organisation Oulun Kärpät and the event's official, promotional vehicle is a white/yellow coloured VW Kleinbus from 1965.
Qstock has its online TV channel called 'QTV' which releases new episodes throughout the Spring, with interviews from each summer's upcoming festival lineup. The full length episodes can be viewed via Qstock Festival's Youtube channel.
