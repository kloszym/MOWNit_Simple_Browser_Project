== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
Johan Christian Fabricius originally discovered and classified Belonogaster juncea juncea in 1781. Belonogaster juncea juncea belongs to the genus Belonogaster which consists of over 80 species of primitively eusocial wasps. In general, the genus is Afrotropical. The genus consists of independent-founding species, meaning that colonies are founded by either one or a few foundresses. Individuals in colonies of various Belonogaster species, such as B. grisea, B. petiolata, and B. j. juncea also tend to display aggressive behavior toward other members of the same colony.
There are two subspecies of Belonogaster juncea: Belonogaster juncea colonials and Belonogaster juncea juncea.
