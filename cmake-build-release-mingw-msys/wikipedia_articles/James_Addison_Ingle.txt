== Early life and education ==
Born on March 11, 1867, in Frederick, Maryland, Ingle was the son of Rev. Osborne Ingle (1837-1909), who served more than four decades as rector of All Saints Church, Frederick, Maryland, and his wife Mary Mills Addison.
Ingle attended the local Frederick schools, then graduated from the Episcopal High School of Virginia at Alexandria, Virginia. He obtained his B.A. degree from the University of Virginia in 1885 and his M.A. from the same institution in 1888. After teaching at a private academy in Charlottesville in 1886-7, Ingle decided to study for the priesthood. He graduated from Virginia Theological Seminary (in 1891), and was ordained deacon at his home parish, All Saints Church, Frederick, on 29 January 1891 by Bishop William Paret. The same prelate raised to him the priesthood in Baltimore on June 7, 1891, and young Rev. Ingle left on a boat for China that October.
