Cimbres Marian apparition is a series of visions of the Virgin Mary that occurred in 1936 and 1937 in Northeastern Brazil, in the Pernambuco state municipality of Pesqueira, district of Cimbres.


== Context ==
According to what is believed, the Virgin Mary would have appeared to two seers, Maria da Luz (who later adopted the name Adélia on the occasion of her entry into religious life) and Maria da Conceição, who, at the time of the facts, were poor and uneducated adolescents. The apparition happened in an exposed inselberg near the girl's family house, partially covered by thorny bushes and slippery moss, and next to deep gullies, a place dangerous to reach on foot. Though the climate there is semiarid, after the apparition the inselberg started flowing potable water. These events became famous for the rigor with which they were ascertained by the German missionary Fr. Joseph Kehrle, who was answered by the illiterate girls in both Latin and German languages, as well as for the content of the message that the Virgin Mary would have transmitted to the seers, alerting them about how Brazil would be deadly punished with Communism.
