The Northern New Guinea lowland rain and freshwater swamp forests is a tropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion of northern New Guinea.


== Setting ==
The Northern New Guinea lowland rain and freshwater swamp forests extend across the northern lowlands of the island of New Guinea, lying between the New Guinea Central Range to the south and the Pacific Ocean to the north. It extends from the eastern shore of Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia's Papua Province east to Morobe Province of Papua New Guinea.
Several east-west mountain ranges, including the Van Rees Mountains, Foja Mountains, Torricelli Mountains, and Finisterre Mountains, rise from the lowlands; these ranges are home to the distinct Northern New Guinea montane rain forests ecoregion.
The ecoregion is drained by several of New Guinea's large rivers, including the Mamberamo, Sepik, and Ramu, and Markham.

There are extensive freshwater swamp forests in the coastal lowlands and in the Lakes Plains region between...
