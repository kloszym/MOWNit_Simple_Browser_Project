West Campus is an area in the westernmost part of Boston University's Charles River campus in Boston, Massachusetts. The area taken up by West Campus takes up most of the footprint of the former grandstand of Braves Field, whose right field pavilion grandstand is currently used as the primary grandstand for Nickerson Field. The former footprint of the stadium also includes the Case Physical Education Center, whose buildings and adjacent tennis courts take up most of the left field pavilion grandstand area.
West Campus has three high-rises, each housing well over 600 residents. They are named Claflin, Sleeper and Rich Halls after the three founders of Boston University.
West's dining hall differs from the others on campus. Instead of the typical buffet-style cafeteria mode, the dining hall is equipped with numerous food stations (burrito, pasta/Asian noodle toss, vegetarian/vegan, grill, pizza, etc.) where a cook will prepare individual food servings on demand. The dining hall was renovated in the mid-2000s, resulting in a mountain-themed decor.
