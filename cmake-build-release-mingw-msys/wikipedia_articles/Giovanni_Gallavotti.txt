Giovanni Gallavotti is an Italian mathematical physicist, born in Naples on 29 December 1941.
He is the recipient of the "Premio Nazionale Presidente della Repubblica", presso la Classe di Scienze Naturali dell'Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, 18 June 1997, and the Boltzmann Medal awarded by IUPAP- International Union of Pure and Applied Physics), 11 July 2007, with the citation:

For his fundamental contributions to our precise understanding of equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics, including the development of a constructive renormalization group for phase transitions, dynamical systems and quantum liquids. 
He was an Invited Speaker with talk Renormalization theory and group in mathematical physics at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1986 in Berkeley and a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in 1998 in Berlin.
On 2018 he was awarded with the Henri Poincar√© Prize "for his outstanding contributions to equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, quantum field theory, classical mechanics, and chaotic systems, including, in particular, the renormalization theory for interacting fermionic systems and the fluctuation relation for the large deviation functional...
