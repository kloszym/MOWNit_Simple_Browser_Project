Phlegmacium myrtilliphilum is a species of mushroom-forming fungus in the family Cortinariaceae, first described in 2014 as a member of the genus Cortinarius before being reclassified in 2022. It is characterized by its medium-sized fruit bodies with pale yellowish-brown to ochraceous caps, greyish-white gills that turn pale brown with age, and distinctively shaped spores with an elongated apex. This fungus grows in mesic spruce-dominated forests with bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) understory, from which its name derives. Currently known only from the middle boreal zone of Finland and Norway, it appears to be relatively rare and produces its fruiting bodies in autumn.
