As of 1961, Tashkent was generating two television stations, with the main station on channel 3 and a second station on an unknown frequency. The Tashkent station also relayed its signal to other cities in the Uzbek SSR.
Two new channels were launched by the company in early 2013: Madaniyat va Maʼrifat ('Culture and Enlightenment') and Dunyo boʻylab ('Around the World'). By the end of the year, four new channels were launched using the frequencies of private television channels which were prohibited by the Uzbek authorities.
In January 2013, the organisation's website was hacked by someone who was going with the handle @CloneSecurity. The attack was said to have been launched for political reasons.
