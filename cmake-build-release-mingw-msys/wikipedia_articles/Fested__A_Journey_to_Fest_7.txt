FESTED: A Journey To Fest 7 is a documentary film about the yearly punk music festival held in Gainesville, Florida simply called The Fest.
It was filmed over two weeks spent in Gainesville around Fest 7 in 2008. The film follows Gainesville's SPANISH GAMBLE (formerly DIRTY MONEY) and friends on their quest to play and experience the epic weekend-long festival that has been called things like "punk rock christmas", "a big, drunk, punk rock, bearded, tattooed family reunion", and "the last true home of punk rock".

In the spirit of Penelope Spheeris' Decline Of Western Civilization series, FESTED features interviews, performances, and who-knows-what from over 20 bands...
