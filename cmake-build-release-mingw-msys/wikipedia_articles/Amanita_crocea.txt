Amanita crocea, the saffron ringless amanita, is a species of Amanita widely distributed in Europe. It is not recommended for consumption due to its similarity to poisonous species of the genus.


== Description ==

Cap: The cap is free of rings with the volva and has a diameter of 5–10 centimetres (2–4 inches), yellow-orange in colour with an apricot tinge at the centre. It expands to become flat or sometimes convex at the umbo, a  small raised central area.
Volva: Thick, white, at least 4–10 cm (1+1⁄2–4 in) wide, saffron orange or a little browner than that in colour in the centre when fresh and paler at the margin.
Gills: Gills are free and cream in mass (sometimes with a slight salmon or pinkish reflection, and 2–3± millimetres broad.)
Stem/stipe: The stem or stipe is 10–15 cm (4–6 in) long and 1–1.5 cm in diameter, tapering, decorated with paler fibrils in a "flame" pattern, with the decoration later becoming orange or brown-orange (darker than the underlying stipe surface) with a membranous sack-like volva at the base.
Spores: The white spores measure (8.0-) 9.4 - 11.8 (-18.8) x (7.5-) 8.5 - 11.0 (-16.0) μm.
