Ehsaas: The Feeling  is a 2001 Indian Hindi-language film starring Sunil Shetty and Neha Bajpai.


== Plot ==
After the death of his wife, Aditi, Ravi Naik (Sunil Shetty) must look after his only child – a son – on his own. He brings up his son, Rohan (Mayank Tandon), in a very strict and disciplined atmosphere, so much so that his son starts to resent him and his mannerisms. His immediate neighbors, Antara Pandit (Neha Bajpai) and her mom (Kirron Kher), are critical of the way Ravi handles his son and suggest that he adopt a more lenient view. But Ravi ignores this advice. All he wants is to get Rohan to excel as an athlete and win the forthcoming athletic event.
