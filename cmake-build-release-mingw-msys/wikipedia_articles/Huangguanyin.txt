Huang Guanyin tea (simplified Chinese: 黄观音茶; traditional Chinese: 黄觀音茶; pinyin: Huáng Guānyīn chá; pronounced [kwán.ín ʈʂʰǎ]) is a Wuyi oolong with a creamy taste. It can be either tightly rolled like Anxi Oolongs or in strips like conventional Wuyi Oolong.
In China, Guanyin leaves are harvested fresh and green, then soaked, beaten, milled, and the sieved puree set up to make GuanYin LiangFen grass jelly.
