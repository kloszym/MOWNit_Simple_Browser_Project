Vasaorden is a Swedish royal barge originally constructed in 1774 based on a design by Fredrik Henrik af Chapman. It is used for ceremonies such as state visits and royal weddings.
It is 17.88 meters (58.7 ft) long and 3.1 meters (10 ft) wide.

After the original barge was destroyed in a fire on 8 August 1921, an exact replica was constructed and launched in 1923.
