The Battle of Montenaken was fought between the forces of Liège and the Burgundian State on 20 October 1465 as part of the First Liège War. Although outnumbered, the Burgundian force succeeded in routing the militia of Liège, inflicting heavy casualties.


== Background ==
The War of the Public Weal between Louis XI and many of his senior nobles began in March 1465. As a consequence, the Burgundian State found itself at war with France. Louis, anxious to find allies, entered into talks with the city of Liège, which had historical grievances with Burgundy, leading to a military treaty in June 1465. With the major part of the Burgundian army, under Charles, Count of Charolais, engaged in France, the Liègois declared war on Burgundy on 28 August. Despite having most of his forces committed in France, the elderly Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, rapidly assembled a force to defend his possessions against the attack of Liège.


== Armies ==
The Liegois army, commanded by Raes de Lyntre, Lord of Heers was approximately 2-3,000 strong, mostly infantry with some field artillery. The Burgundian force was about 1,800 strong, mostly cavalry, not all of whom took part in the battle.
