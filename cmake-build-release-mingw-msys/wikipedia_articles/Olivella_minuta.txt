Olivella minuta, common name the minute dwarf olive, is a species of small sea snail, marine gastropod mollusk in the subfamily Olivellinae, in the family Olividae, the olives.  Species in the genus Olivella are commonly called dwarf olives.


== Description ==
The size of the shell varies between 6 mm and 15 mm.
This species has a small, oblong shell which comes to a conical point on the front end, this is similar to other marine snail shells. They have brown patterning on the middle section of their shells that can range from a chevron patterning to a random dispersement of lines and blotches to many more varieties. Their common size is 13mm, though they can naturally grow larger than these.


== Distribution ==
This marine species is widely distributed, over the seas of the Western Hemisphere. They live in the tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and off the Lesser Antilles. They can be found off the coasts of Colombia, San Andres, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, and Puerto Rico, but these shells have been found as far south as Argentina, so it is likely that they live wherever the waters are warm enough.
