Alexandra Dock was a station located on the Liverpool Overhead Railway, west of Regent Road (A565) and within the MDHC Dock Estate. The station was named after the adjacent Alexandra Dock.
The station was opened on the 6 March 1893 by the Marquis of Salisbury and was the northern terminus of the line until it was extended to Seaforth Sands just over a year later.
The station closed, along with the rest of the line, on 30 December 1956. No evidence of this station remains.
