Zug United is a floorball club based in Zug, Switzerland. The club was founded in 2004 through the collaboration of the teams UHC Einhorn Hünenberg, UHC Astros Rotkreuz, UHC Zugerland, UHC White Indians Baar-Inwil and UHC Zuger Highlands from the canton of Zug.
The men's team competes in the Unihockey Prime League, the highest Swiss floorball league. They first advanced to the league for the 2011–12 season but failed to remain in the competition. They returned to the league permanently in 2017. In 2020, the team won the Swiss Cup. During the 2023–24 season, they claimed their first league championship title (as well as winning the cup again).
The women's team also competes in the top league, continuing the legacy of its predecessor, UHC Zuger Highlands. In the 2023–24 season, the team achieved the title of league runner-up, won gold in the Swiss Cup, and claimed victory in the Supercup. The team also holds three additional Swiss Cup titles from 2003 (as UHC Zuger Highlands), 2007, and 2014.
