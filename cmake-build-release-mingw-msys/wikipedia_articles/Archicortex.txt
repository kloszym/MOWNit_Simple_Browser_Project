The archicortex, or archipallium, is the phylogenetically second oldest region of the brain's cerebral cortex (the oldest is the paleocortex). In older species, such as fish, the archipallium makes up most of the cerebrum. Amphibians develop an archipallium and paleopallium. 
In humans, the archicortex makes up the three cortical layers of the hippocampus. It has fewer cortical layers than both the neocortex, which has six, and the paleocortex, which has either four or five. The archicortex, along with the paleocortex and periallocortex, is a subtype of allocortex. Because the number of cortical layers that make up a type of cortical tissue seems to be directly proportional to both the information-processing capabilities of that tissue and its phylogenetic age, the archicortex is thought to be the oldest and most basic type of cortical tissue.

The archicortex is most prevalent in the olfactory cortex and the hippocampus, which are responsible for processing smells and forming memories, respectively. Because olfaction is considered to be the phylogenetically oldest sensory modality, and the limbic system, of which the hippocampus is a part, is one of the oldest systems...
