Akizzi (Akk. ma-ki-iz-zi) was the King of Qatna around 1350-1345 BC. He is also known as a writer of several of the Amarna Letters, im which he requested aid from the pharaoh against invaders. He was a successor of Idanda. While Idanda is known from an archive in Qatna, no archive has been found within Qatna that contained letters belonging to Akizzi; instead, letters Akizzi sent were found in Amarna.
It is unclear if Akizzi used the titles LU (man) or LUGAL (king) for himself. He used the former title for surrounding pettery rulers, and the latter title for himself in one letter (Amarna Letter EA 57).

As Tushratta of Mitanni lost control of the territory west of the Euphrates, the former vassal states were faced with trying to align themselves with Egypt or submit to Suppiluliuma I of Hatti.
Akizzi wrote several letters of the Amarna letters correspondence. Here he pleaded for help from the Egyptians against the Hittite invasion into former Mitanni territory. Even earlier Egyptian kings (i.e. Thutmose III) had campaigned in this region, which Akizzi tries to refer to as a cause for the Egyptian king to come and "reclaim his" territory.
