The ornate skink (Oligosoma ornatum) is a rare species of skink endemic to New Zealand. Once widespread across the North Island, habitat destruction and predation by introduced species has now reduced their range to scattered localities throughout the North Island and offshore islands.


== Taxonomy ==
The species was first described as Tiliqua ornata by John Edward Gray in 1843. It was placed in the genus Cyclodina by Graham S. Hardy in 1977, and was moved to its modern genus Oligosoma in 2009 based on phylogenetic analysis. Both the species epithet ornatum and the species' common name refer to the ornate patterns on the skink species.


== Description ==
Ornate skinks have a snout–vent length of up to 84 mm (3.3 in), and can weigh as much as 11.5 g (0.41 oz). The species has a short snout, a teardrop marking beneath its eyes, and black markings along the neck and shoulders. Individuals of the species vary in terms of the shade of brown on their bodies and patterning. The population found on Manawatāwhi / Three Kings Islands is morphologically distinct, having longer snouts, more slender bodies, and less contrasting underside surfaces. Specimens from the Northland Region can also have...
