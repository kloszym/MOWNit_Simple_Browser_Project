== Broadcasting career ==
Mitchell began his broadcasting career at the age of 17 at pirate radio station Carousel in Dundalk. He later worked as a BBC radio producer for the Walter Love show Day by Day and presented the early morning weekday show and Saturday lunchtime shows on Downtown Radio before he joined Ulster Television in 1987 as a continuity announcer and newsreader. He has presented a range of popular TV shows including UTV Life, School Around The Corner, End to End and Ultimate Ulster. His U105 Radio phone-in has become one of the most exciting in Ireland with a fast moving range of topics guided by his sharp questions and equally sharp wit.
Mitchell remained on the announcing staff until 1993 when he became the station's chief weather presenter and news programme features reporter.
Mitchell also co-hosted and reported for UTV's GAA discussion series End to End between 2001 and 2004. Mitchell presented the entertainment series School Around the Corner from 1996 to 2005...
