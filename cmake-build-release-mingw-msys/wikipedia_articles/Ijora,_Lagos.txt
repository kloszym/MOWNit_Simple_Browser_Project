Ijora is a settlement in Lagos, Nigeria.


== History ==
Ijora was originally a swampy and water-logged village where residents coming from Lagos Island could reach their homes with the use of canoes. The establishment of a railway terminus at Iddo, a nearby settlement boosted the importance of Ijora. In 1919, the colonial government commissioned a coal wharf at Ijora to unload coal for the use of the Nigerian Railway and the Ijora Thermal Station. In 1923, the government constructed the Ijora Thermal Station to generate electricity for the railway and the environs close to Ijora. In the 1960s, the Lagos State town planning authority and the Federal Government of Nigeria decided to zone tracts of land in the area for industrial use The new zoning led to the draining and further reclamation of land.
The industrial estate used to be a base for the firms: K Maroun, Incar cars and West African Cold Storage. The Ijora wharf also functioned as an offloading point for frozen food.
