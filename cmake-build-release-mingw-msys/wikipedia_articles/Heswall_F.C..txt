In 1958 the club rejoined Division Two of the West Cheshire League, finishing as runners-up at their first attempt. The club remained in Division Two until the end of the 1968–69 season, when they earned promotion to Division One as champions. The club remained in Division one until  the end of the 1981–82 season, when they left the league. Just a few seasons before this the club made its debut in the FA Vase in the 1978–79 season, but getting knocked out immediately by Linotype F.C. in the preliminary qualify round. They did better the following season, making it to the 3rd round, a feat they would repeat a further two times.
