The Wallace Art Awards was an annual visual arts award ceremony in New Zealand, established in 1992 and running until 2021. Their goal was to "support, promote and expose contemporary New Zealand art and artists".


== History ==
The awards were established by James Wallace in 1992. Awards were made for contemporary painting, sculpture and photography and were run by the James Wallace Charitable Arts Trust. By 2021 the prizes offered were valued at more than NZ$275,000 and included the offer of artists' residencies overseas. The New Zealand Herald described the list of award recipients as "an arts world who's who".
The 2018 awards were presented by the Rt Hon Dame Patsy Reddy at the Pah Homestead, Auckland on 3 September 2018. In 2020, the trust did not offer residencies as prizes and instead offered cash equivalent prizes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The awards were cancelled in 2021, with the James Wallace Charitable Arts Trust announcing that it was "refreshing" its strategic plan. In 2023, when Wallace's 2021 conviction for sexual offending was made public, it was reported that the trust had ended its relationship with Wallace and been renamed The Arts House Trust.
