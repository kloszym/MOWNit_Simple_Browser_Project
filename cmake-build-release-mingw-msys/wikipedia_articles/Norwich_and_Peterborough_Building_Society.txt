Norwich & Peterborough Building Society (N&P) is a trading name of Yorkshire Building Society based in Bradford, West Yorkshire. Formed by the merger of the Norwich and Peterborough building societies in 1986, at the time of merger with YBS, it was the ninth largest building society in the United Kingdom, with assets in excess of Â£4.9 billion. 
The Society had over 45 branch offices mainly located in East Anglia and the surrounding counties of Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire, but there was also a branch in Gibraltar (which opened in 1990 and closed in 2014) and High Holborn, London. The former Head Office was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Second in 1988, on a green field business park at Lynch Wood, Peterborough, where an important operational presence is retained by the Yorkshire. N&P employed over 800 staff, of whom roughly half were based at Lynch Wood.
In January 2017, parent YBS Group announced the proposed closure of 28 (later increased to 31) branches, all current accounts and the eventual withdrawal of the N&P brand. Remaining N&P branches closed on Friday 6 July 2018 and re-opened on Monday 9 July as YBS branches.
