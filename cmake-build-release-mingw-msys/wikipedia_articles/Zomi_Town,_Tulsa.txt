Zomi Town, Tulsa is an ethnic enclave in Tulsa, Oklahoma, inhabited by approximately 7,000 to 9,000 immigrants from the Zomi ethnic group, who originally hail from the mountainous regions of northwestern Myanmar. The community consists of individuals who sought refuge in the United States to escape religious and political persecution in their homeland. Over time, some residents arrived directly in Tulsa, while others relocated from different states within the U.S.
