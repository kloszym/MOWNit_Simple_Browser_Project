Emily Bridges (born 4 January 2001) is a transgender woman from Cwmbran who was a British track cyclist. She began competitive cycling at the age of 10 and set a national junior men's record over 25 miles in 2018. Bridges joined the GB cycling team in 2020 but left to focus on her transition. Bridges publicly came out as transgender in 2020 and began hormone therapy in 2021.
In 2022, she sought to rejoin the team for the 2024 Olympics, but British Cycling's decision to ban transgender women from competing in the womenâ€™s category in 2023 affected her eligibility.
In 2023, Bridges was included in a list of influential women by British Vogue magazine.
