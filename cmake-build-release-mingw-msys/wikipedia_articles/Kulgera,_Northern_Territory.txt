== History ==
Kulgera is the Pitjantjatjara name for an outcrop of granite rocks just east of the settlement. According to Nicolas Rothwell, Kulgera is derived from kalgka in the Pertam language of the mountains and that word "refers to a particularly private recess of a private part of the female anatomy".
A pastoral lease of 1,370 square kilometres (530 sq mi) to the north east of the outcrop was granted to the Coulthard family in 1928 and was named Kulgera Station.
