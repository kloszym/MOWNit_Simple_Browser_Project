In 1963, the company began selling Toyota commercial vehicles. Between 1968 and 1988, under Sidney's son Jim Crawford, the business expanded and diversified, developing three divisions, CMV Automotive, CMV Trucks and CMV Farms. These divisions grew, both through reinvestment of revenue and by the acquisition of new franchises.
In 2016 CMV managing director Paul Crawford was presented with the Australian Entrepreneur of the Year Industry Prize.
