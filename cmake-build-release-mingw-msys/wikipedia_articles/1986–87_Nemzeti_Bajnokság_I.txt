Statistics of Nemzeti Bajnokság I in the 1986–87 season.


== Overview ==
It was contested by 16 teams, and MTK Hungária FC won the championship, breaking their 29-year long drought, under headcoach József Verebes. Although MTK started off the season with back-'to-back losses to Békéscsaba and Szombathelyi Haladás, and had to wait for their first win until round 4, the blue and whites went on a 5-; then a 6-game winning streak, only suffering 2 losses in the remainder of the campaign.
In April Tatabánya ended MTK's 11-game unbeaten streak in the league, defeating them 1-0. MTK's goalless draw against Fehérvár the following week allowed Újpest to take the first spot of the table. However, the purple and whites suffered two surprise defeats to Békéscsaba and Siófok, and eventually finished runners-up. MTK's status as champions was confirmed on the 7th of June, after they held Újpest to a 0-0 draw. This was MTK's 19th championship.
