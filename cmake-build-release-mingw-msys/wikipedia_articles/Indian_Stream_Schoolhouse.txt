== Description and history ==
The Indian Stream Schoolhouse stands in southern Pittsburg, on the west side of Tabor Road, just west of its junction with United States Route 3, amid a small cluster of houses.  The eponymous Indian Stream flows south toward the Connecticut River a short way to the east.  The school is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior.  Its roof is topped by a small square open belfry.  The main facade is symmetrical, with a center entrance flanked by sash windows with shallow corniced lintels.  A pair of similar windows appear in the attic level.  The building corners have pilaster-like raised corner boards, and there are decorative jigsawn brackets at the corners of the eaves.
