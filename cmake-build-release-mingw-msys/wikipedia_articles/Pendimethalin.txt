Pendimethalin is an herbicide of the dinitroaniline class used premergently and postemergently to control annual grasses and certain broadleaf weeds. It inhibits cell division and cell elongation. Pendimethalin is a K1-group (in Australia group D, or numerically group 3) according to the Herbicide Resistance Action Committee (HRAC) classification and is approved in Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Asia and Oceania for different crops including cereals (wheat, barley, rye, triticale), corn, soybeans, rice, potato, legumes, fruits, vegetables, and nuts, plus lawns and ornamental plants.

Pendimethalin protects crops like wheat, corn, soybeans, potatoes, cabbage, peas, carrots, and asparagus. It is used to control annual grasses and certain broadleaf weeds which interfere with growth, development, yield and quality of agricultural and horticultural crops by competing on nutrients, water and light.
Where weed infestation is particularly bad, yield loss can render wheat production uneconomical. Many other crops are grown in Europe that make a fraction of total agriculture. Herbicide options are limited for these minor crops, particularly in the vegetable sector. Long...
