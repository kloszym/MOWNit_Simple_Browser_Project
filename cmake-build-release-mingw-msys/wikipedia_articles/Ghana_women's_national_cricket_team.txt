The Ghana national women's cricket team is the team that represents Ghana in international women's cricket.
Ghana participated in the inaugural 2015 North West Africa Cricket Council (NWACC) women's tournament held in The Gambia. The team finished third behind Sierra Leone and Gambia, and ahead of Mali. Ghana hosted the second edition of the tournament in 2016.
In April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Ghana women and other ICC members after 1 July 2018 will have the full WT20I status. Ghana played their first official WT20I matches in March 2022 during the 2022 Nigeria Invitational Women's T20I Tournament.
