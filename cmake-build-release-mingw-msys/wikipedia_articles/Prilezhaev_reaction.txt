The Prilezhaev reaction, also known as the Prileschajew reaction or Prilezhaev epoxidation, is the chemical reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid to form epoxides.  It is named after Nikolai Prilezhaev, who first reported this reaction in 1909.  A widely used peroxy acid for this reaction is meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA), due to its stability and good solubility in most organic solvents. The reaction is performed in inert solvents (C6H14, C6H6, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CCl4) between -10 and 60 Â°C with the yield of 60-80%.
An illustrative example is the epoxidation of trans-2-butene with m-CPBA to give trans-2,3-epoxybutane:

 
The oxygen atom that adds across the double bond of the alkene is taken from the peroxy acid, generating a molecule of the corresponding carboxylic acid as a byproduct. The reaction is highly stereospecific in the sense that the double bond stereochemistry is generally transferred to the relative configuration of the epoxide with essentially perfect fidelity, so that a trans-olefin leads to the stereoselective formation of the trans-2,3-substituted epoxide only, as illustrated by the example above, while a cis-olefin would only give the cis-epoxide.  This stereochemical...
