Israeli Song is an album by saxophonist Eli Degibri.


== Background and recording ==
This was Degibri's fifth recording as leader. Most of the tracks are Degibri's originals; the other band members wrote one each. On the title track, "After a slowly unfurling a capella intro, Degibri moves into the gorgeous melody supported by Mehldau's slow chordal accompaniment."


== Reception ==
The Down Beat reviewer observed that, "Though the members of the band shine during their individual solos, the musicians are deferential to Degibri's spirited tenor and soprano playing."
