Democratic Socialism (Spanish: Socialismo Democrático [sosjaˈlismo ðemoˈkɾatiko], SD) is a Chilean centre-left political coalition established on 2021, by the Socialist Party, Party for Democracy, Radical Party, Liberal Party and the platform New Deal.
The pact emerged after the de facto dissolution of the New Social Pact and did not include the Christian Democratic Party, which meant the end of the historic alliance between socialist and christian democrats, which had been in force since the transition to democracy in 1990.
In December 2021, Democratic Socialism was called to be part of the government of President Gabriel Boric. The parties joined a coalition with Apruebo Dignidad and came to government on March 11, 2022.
