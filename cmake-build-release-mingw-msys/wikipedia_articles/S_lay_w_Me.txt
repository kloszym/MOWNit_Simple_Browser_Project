S/lay w/Me is a role-playing game published by Adept Press in 2009.


== Description ==
S/lay w/Me is a two-player fantasy game set in a sword and sorcery setting where one, the player, is the hero while the other, the gamemaster, takes on the role of both the hero's lover and the hero's monstrous opponent. The game is contained within a 29-page rulebook. Although the title, interior art of nude women, and text all suggest a sexual narrative will develop, nothing in the rules demands sexualized content.


=== Character generation ===
The player says aloud, "I am myself. I am smart, brutal and full of experience. I laugh in the face of the gods. I enjoy my existence. My enemies die quickly." The player then selects a Hero from a list of nine archetypes, and describes the hero's appearance. From a list of 17 places, the player selects a beginning location. Finally, the player decides on a goal for the Hero.
The gamemaster then develops the location more fully, and chooses a Monster and a Lover, selecting one Attack for the Monster from a list of eight, and one Desire for the Lover from a list of eight. The gamemaster then randomly generates a score of 4–6 for the Monster and 1–2 for the Lover...
