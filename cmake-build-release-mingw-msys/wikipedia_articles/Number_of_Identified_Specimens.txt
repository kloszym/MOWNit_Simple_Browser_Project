In various archaeological disciplines including archaeology, forensic anthropology, bioarchaeology, osteoarchaeology and zooarchaeology, the number of identified specimens (also number of individual specimens or number of individual species), or NISP, is defined as the number of identified specimens for a specific site. It is used to estimate how many different individual specimens are present. 
When evaluating the potential benefits of new sites or specimens, the three most commonly used quantification units by archaeology are NISP, minimum number of elements (MNE), and minimum number of individuals (MNI).
The NISP is the most basic quantity recorded about an osteological assemblage. It counts the number of skeletal elements identified by bone type and taxon, and was first used in zooarchaeology. To calculate the NISP, bones are sorted into taxa (when dealing with a mixed species assemblage) and then into skeletal element types.
An alternative estimate to the NISP, often done in concert, is the MNI. Both are influenced by fragmentation and degree of preservation, but in different ways. In practice, the NISP will normally be higher than the MNI; for example, if the NISP is 100 human...
