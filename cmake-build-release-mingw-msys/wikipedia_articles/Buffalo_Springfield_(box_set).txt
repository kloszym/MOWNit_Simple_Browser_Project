Buffalo Springfield is a career retrospective album by the 1960s folk rock band of the same name, released in 2001.  Band member Neil Young assembled the tracks in chronological order to show how the band evolved and disintegrated in the span of two years, as encompassed through the first three CDs, while the fourth disc contains the band's first two albums, all but three tracks of which had already appeared in identical versions elsewhere on the first three discs. The box set reached number 194 on Billboard's Top 200 album chart, and stayed on the chart for one week.
