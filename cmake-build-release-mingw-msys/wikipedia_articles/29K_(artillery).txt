The 29-K was an anti-aircraft truck used by the Soviet Union, consisting of a 76 mm air defense gun M1931 mounted on a YaG-10 truck.


== History ==
In 1934, the Design Bureau (KB) Plant No. 8, named after Mikhail Kalinin, received an order to install the 76 mm air defense gun M1931 on the chassis of the three-axle YaG-10 truck. Production completed by the Yaroslavl Automobile Plant, due to their experience with creating the SU-8.
In Augustâ€“September 1936, tests were carried out at the NIAP test site. The first vehicles entered service with Moscow Military District.
The 29-K took part in the parade on Red Square in Moscow. The first display of motorized anti-aircraft guns took place at a military parade in Moscow on 1 May 1934. Overall, sixty-one YaG-10 trucks were converted into 29-K models.
Modifications to the trucks included a reinforced undercarriage, four stabilizing legs with jacks were added to the underside, rotating pedestal for the gun, and side boards replaced with semi-circular armor plates that could be reclined in combat to create additional space for the crew to operate.
