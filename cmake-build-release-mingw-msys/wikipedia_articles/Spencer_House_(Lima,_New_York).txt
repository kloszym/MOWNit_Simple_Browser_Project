Spencer House is a historic home located at Lima in Livingston County, New York. It is believed to date to the 1830s, enlarged in the 1850s and 1860s.  It is a two-story, L-shaped frame building with clapboard siding, a cobblestone foundation, and low-pitched gable roofs.  The main block evinces the persistence of Federal period architectural traditions with the two-story, three-bay, side-hall form, delicate louvered fan in the front gable, and slender frieze and corner boards. Also on the property is a contributing 19th century carriage house.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.
