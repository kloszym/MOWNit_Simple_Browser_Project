Thomas Lawrence Connelly (February 14, 1938 – January 18, 1991) was an American historian and author who specialized in the Civil War era. He is perhaps best known for his book, The Marble Man: Robert E. Lee and His Image in American Society, one of the most scholarly and critical books on Robert E. Lee.


== Early life and education ==
Connelly was born February 14, 1938, in Nashville, Tennessee, to Fred Marlin (1909-1983) and Mildred Inez Connelly (1911-1983). As a boy, he visited the Nashville Civil War battlefield. Growing up in the Nashville area gave him a love of country music and spurred his desire to write more about the war in Tennessee. Connelly became one of the most prominent scholars of the war in the western theater in a scholarly field dominated by books about Virginia and its military leaders. Part of his mission to highlight the war in the West was personal. He was frustrated by the fact that his own family's Civil War history was shrouded in rumor and legend. "Scores of personal experiences," he wrote later, "a handful of tales related by an old man, and a shoe box of bullet fragments—such is one family's heritage in the Army of Tennessee."
