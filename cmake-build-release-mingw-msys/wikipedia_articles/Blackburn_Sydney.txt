The Blackburn R.B.2 Sydney (serial N241) was a long-range maritime patrol flying boat developed for the Royal Air Force in 1930 in response to Air Ministry Specification R.5/27. It was a parasol-winged braced monoplane with a typical flying boat configuration, featuring triple tailfins and three engines mounted on the wing's leading edge. After evaluation, it was not ordered into production, and no further examples were built.
With development of the Sydney abandoned, the construction of a cargo-carrying variant powered by radial engines, the C.B.2 Nile, was also discontinued.
