Domesticated sheep are herd animals that are bred for agricultural trade. A flock of sheep is mated by a single ram, which has either been chosen by a farmer or, in feral populations, has established dominance through physical contests with other rams. Sheep have a breeding season (tupping) in the autumn, though some can breed year-round.
As a result of the influence of humans on sheep breeding, ewes often produce multiple lambs. This increase in lamb births, both in number and birth weight, may cause problems with delivery and lamb survival, requiring the intervention of shepherds.


== Sexual behaviour ==
Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months of age, and rams generally between four and six (though ram lambs have occasionally been known to impregnate their mothers at two months). Sheep are seasonally polyoestrus animals. Ewes enter into estrus cycles about every 17 days, which last for approximately 30 hours. They indicate sexual readiness through physical displays towards rams and emitting a scent. The Flehmen response is exhibited by rams when they smell the urine of a ewe in estrus. The vomeronasal organ has receptors which detect the estrogen in the ewe's urine...
