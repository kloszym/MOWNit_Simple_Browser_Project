The former logo of the council was selected from 124 competition entries in 1987. The enlarged "W" below Table Cape is indicative of ploughed paddocks representing the rural heritage – a lighthouse and a seagull were added to the final design. The word "Waratah" was added in 1993 following the amalgamation of the councils.
