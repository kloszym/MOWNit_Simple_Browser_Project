The Chief of Staff of People's National Army (Arabic: رئيس أركان الجيش الوطني الشعبي, romanized: Raʾīs ʾArkān al-Ǧayš al-Waṭanī al-Šaʿbī; French: Chef d'État-Major de l'Armée nationale populaire) is the highest position in the Algerian People's National Army. It was left empty for many years after Chief of Staff Tahar Zbiri staged a coup attempt against President Houari Boumédiène. 
The current chief of staff is Saïd Chengriha, who has served in the position in an acting capacity since the death of Ahmed Gaid Salah on 23 December 2019.
