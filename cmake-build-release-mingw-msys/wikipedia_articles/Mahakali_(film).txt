== Reception ==
A critic from The Times of India wrote that "A complete Malashree film and that's all there is to it". A critic from Deccan Herald wrote that "Well, if you are fed on the exploits of Malashri, Mahakali is your best bet, with our girl going hammer and tongs at men, trying to right their misdeeds". A critic from Bangalore Mirror wrote that "Despite the presence of a veteran like Mahendar and Malashree, the film looks like an unprofessional product". A critic from The Hindu wrote that "Camera work comprised jarring shots that attempt to highlight the iconic status of Malashree. Comedy scenes reduce women to mere objects of desire, often negating the spirit of womenâ€™s empowerment that the rest of the film stands for".
