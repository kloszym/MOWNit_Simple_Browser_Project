Rapperswil-Jona–Technikum is one of the 111 serial sites of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps, of which are 56 located in Switzerland. It is a small former island in the upper Lake Zürich in Rapperswil, a locality of the municipality of Rapperswil-Jona in the Canton of St. Gallen. 


== Geography ==
The former island is located south of the former Technicum university in Rapperswil and not far away from the prehistoric lake crossings. Because the lake has grown in size over time, the original piles are now around 3 metres (10 ft) under the water level of 406 metres (1,332 ft). The site comprises 0.92 hectares (2.27 acres) and the buffer zone comprises 49.1 hectares (121.33 acres).


== Description ==
Multiple palisades and a clear visible settlement structure characterise the Early Bronze Age site dated in the 17th century BC. It points to the same period as the early footbridges between Rapperswil and Hurden-Rosshorn. The settlement was certainly of great importance as the centre of the region, and it may even have played a role in controlling this important transport route.


== Finds ==
The finds include ceramic and dress pins, daggers, arrowheads...
