The flight was operated by Hawaii Clipper, one of the three Pan American Martin M-130 flying boats. It disappeared with six passengers and nine crew.


== Background ==
Pan American initiated trans-Pacific airmail service on 22 November 1935, and began carrying passengers in October 1936. The flying boat service between San Francisco Bay and Manila Bay required about 60 hours of flying time over six days, with intermediate stops at Pearl Harbor, Midway Atoll, Wake Island, and Guam.

Flight 229 first took off from Alameda, California and landed at Guam, without incident. The flight departed Guam on the last leg of the westbound journey at 11:39 local time on 28 July 1938. The last radio contact was 3 hours 27 minutes later, when the aircraft reported flying through layers of clouds and moderately rough air 565 miles (909 km) from the Philippine coast.
