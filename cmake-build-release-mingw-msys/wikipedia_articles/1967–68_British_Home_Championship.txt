The 1967–68 British Home Championship was the 1967–68 staging of an annual football competition for the British Home Nations. In addition, the results were combined with those of the previous season's championship to form qualifying Group 8 for the 1968 European Championship. 
The tournament was a single round-robin with two points for a win and no ranking tiebreakers like goal difference. England won their first two games, against Wales and Ireland, and going into the final match they were guaranteed at least a share of the Home Championship, but a win for Scotland would see them win the Euro qualifying group. A hard-fought draw gave both titles outright to England. Ireland had surprisingly beat Scotland, but shared third place with Wales after losing to them in the last match.
