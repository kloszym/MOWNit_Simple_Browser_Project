The flea beetle is any small, jumping beetle of the leaf beetle family (Chrysomelidae) that is part of the tribe Alticini, which is part of the subfamily Galerucinae. Historically the flea beetles were classified as their own subfamily.
Traditionally, the Alticini were separated from other Galerucinae by the presence of jumping hind legs, characterised by enlarged femora containing a spring structure allowing the flea beetles to jump. Recent phylogenetic studies suggest that jumping hind legs evolved multiple times in the Galerucinae, rather than once, and that several genera should be transferred between Alticini and Galerucinae sensu stricto (or Galerucini in some classifications).


== Description and ecology ==
The adults are very small to moderately sized Chrysomelidae (i.e. among beetles in general they are on the smallish side). They are similar to other leaf beetles, but characteristically have the hindleg femora greatly enlarged. These enlarged femora allow for the springing action of these insects when disturbed. The jumping mechanism of flea beetles has been studied extensively. One study looked at several species of flea beetles, including the Altica cirsicola species, and...
