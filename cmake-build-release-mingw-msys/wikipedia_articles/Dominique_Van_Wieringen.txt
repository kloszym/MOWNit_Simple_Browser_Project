Van Wieringen began racing motocross at the age of five and eventually moved to kart racing. In 2011, she made the transition to full-sized race cars and scored a feature win at Spartan Speedway in Mason, MI. The following season, she won the Outlaw Super Late Model Championship at Springport Motor Speedway. Moving to the JEGS/CRA All-Star Series in 2013, Van Wieringen became the first female to win on the All-Stars Tour on September 22, 2013, at Lucas Oil Raceway.
Van Wieringen signed with NEMCO Motorsports for the 2015 season, running super late models in various CRA Super Series and CARS-Tour events, occasionally as a teammate to John Hunter Nemechek. After modest success, including leading several races and earning a few top-5s, along with some frustrations, Van Wieringen signed with Mark Rette to drive full-time in the K&N Pro Series East for 2016.
