William Stanley Bryce (Stan) Paterson (20 May 1924 â€“ 8 October 2013) was a leading British glaciologist. He mined glacial cores which then provided climate data for the world's last 100,000 years.


== Academic career ==
In 1953, Paterson joined the British North Greenland Expedition as a surveyor.
In 1956, Paterson joined an expedition to South Georgia where he was involved in the first survey of the island's mountain ranges.
In 1957, Paterson emigrated for work to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, before beginning his studies for a PhD in glaciology at the University of British Columbia the following year.
In 1958, Paterson joined a Scottish East Greenland Expedition to measure the flow rate of a coastal glacier.
Paterson completed his PhD in 1962 and was then appointed to the Canadian Polar Continental Shelf Project (PCSP) as a glaciologist.
For the next few decades, Paterson, and a team of glaciologists he put together, spent time in the Canadian Arctic drilling ice cores and carrying out investigations on the ice caps. Each ice core was analysed in terms of its structure and chemistry and provided pioneering data on the Earth's climate reaching back 100,000 years into history. Some of this...
