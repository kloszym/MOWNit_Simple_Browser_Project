Unsilent Night is a musical composition and participatory performance art piece by American composer Phil Kline which, since its creation in 1992, has been performed around the world annually in December. In the performance of this composition, volunteers carrying boomboxes and other music players parade through the streets of the participating city, presenting an ambient cacophony of recorded bells, harps, and electronic instruments composed by Kline.
