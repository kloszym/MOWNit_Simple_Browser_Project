The adópengő ('tax pengő') was a temporary unit of currency of Hungary between 1 January 1946, when it was introduced to try to stabilise the pengő, and 31 July 1946, when both were replaced by the forint. Initially, the adópengő was only an accounting unit used by the government and commercial banks; later, bonds and savings certificates denominated in adópengő were also issued for the public and replaced pengő notes in circulation.
