A test engineer is a professional who determines how to create a process that would best test a particular product in manufacturing and related disciplines, in order to assure that the product meets applicable specifications. Test engineers are also responsible for determining the best way a test can be performed in order to achieve adequate test coverage. Often test engineers also serve as a liaison between manufacturing, design engineering, sales engineering and marketing communities as well.


== Test engineer expertises ==
Test engineers can have different expertise, which depends on what test process they are more familiar with (although many test engineers have full familiarity from the PCB level processes like ICT, JTAG, and AXI) to PCBA and system level processes like board functional test (BFT or FT), burn-in test, system level test (ST). Some of the processes used in manufacturing where a test engineer is needed are:

In-circuit test (ICT)
Stand-alone JTAG test
Automated x-ray inspection (AXI) (also known as X-ray test)
Automated optical inspection (AOI) test
Center of Gravity (CG) test
Continuity or flying probe test
Electromagnetic compatibility or EMI test
(Board) functional...
