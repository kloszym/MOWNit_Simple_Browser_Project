Mount Ritchie (78°32′S 158°25′E) is a mountain rising over 1600 m in the southeast part of Warren Range, Antarctica. The feature is 5.6 km (3 nmi) northeast of Wise Peak on the west side of Deception Glacier. It was named by the Victoria University of Wellington Antarctic Expedition (VUWAE), 1970–71, after Alex Ritchie, curator of fossils at the Australian Museum, Sydney, a member of the VUWAE party that discovered important sites of fossil fish in this Skelton Neve area.


== Geology ==
Mount Ritchie consists of a thick sequence of well-exposed, sedimentary strata of the Beacon Supergroup capped by a summit composed of an erosional remnant of a dolerite sill belonging to the Ferrar Dolerite sills. The dolerite summit of Mount Ritchie is underlain by 250 metres (820 ft) of the Weller Coal Measures. It is composed of fossiliferous interbedded Permian sandstone, siltstone, shale, and coal. This geologic unit was deposited by ancient braided rivers and streams. Beneath the Weller Coal Measures lies as much as 85 metres (279 ft) of Metschel Tillite. It consists of glacial diamictite, sandstone, and shale. At and just above the contact with undeformed strata of the underlying Aztec Siltstone...
