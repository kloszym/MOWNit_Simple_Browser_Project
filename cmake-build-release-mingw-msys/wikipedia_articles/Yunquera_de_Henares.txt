== Religious Significance ==
Yunquera de Henares is a member of the Parish of San Pedro Ap√≥stol (Saint Peter the Apostle) and is home to the Hermitage of the Farm, in which can be found the church's patron Virgin Mary, "Our Lady of the Farm."  This devotion dates back to at least 1658, which is the oldest written record of the story. The tale is that a local shepherd watching over his sheep witnessed an apparition of the Virgin Mary, who spoke to him. The shepherd shared this with the town, who came to see the image of the Lady and brought it back to the village. The story tells that many sick people in Yunquera were miraculously healed upon seeing the image.
