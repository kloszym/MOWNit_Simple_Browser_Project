== Production ==

== Reception ==
Yolanda Zappaterra wrote in Time Out London: "It's a fascinating life, and containing as it does interviews with Helga, Andrew's son and painter Jamie Wyeth, and Andrew himself before his death in 2009.  A real treat â€“ particularly if you're as ignorant of Wyeth's world as we were." The Independent's Gerard Gilbert called the film "unexpectedly absorbing". John Crace of The Guardian wrote that "Michael Palin in Wyeth's World (BBC2) was a little gem; a one-hour documentary about a 20th-century American painter, Andrew Wyeth, of whom I had never heard, yet which kept me intrigued".
