Iatrosophia (Ancient Greek: ιατρoσóφια, literally 'medical wisdom') is a genre of Greek medical literature, originating in Byzantium. It comprises medical handbooks containing recipes or therapeutic advice, but the term can also be used of orally transmitted medical knowledge.

The earliest known examples date from perhaps as early as the tenth century CE, but they survive in large numbers only from the fifteenth century onwards. After the fall of Byzantium, the iatrosophist tradition was maintained by Greek Orthodox monasteries and in secular, Greek-speaking parts of the Ottoman Empire into the early twentieth century. The texts drew on earlier Greek and Latin medical writing by Hippocratic writers such as Dioscorides and Galen...
