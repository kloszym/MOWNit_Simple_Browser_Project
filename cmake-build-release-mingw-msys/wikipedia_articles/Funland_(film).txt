== Plot ==
Funland is a family-oriented amusement park owned by the eccentric Angus Perry. Niel Stickney, the clown mascot, is both one of the founders of the park and its former accountant. Niel has suffered a nervous breakdown and his grip on reality is slowly deteriorating.
After the mob kills Angus and takes over the park, Stickney begins to have increasingly bizarre hallucinations, including envisioning the patrons of the park cafeteria spontaneously breaking into song and dance, and seeing visions of the dead Angus. He then begins to believe himself to be his clown persona, Bruce Burger.
After the new mafia management fires him, he finally snaps. He steals a briefcase containing a rifle, intending to kill his replacement and reclaim the theme park. While firing the gun, the two sons of the mob boss recognize the sound and investigate. Bruce then shoots and kills one of them in self defense...
