Earl's Court Square is a garden square in Earl's Court, London, England. It was developed from 1872 or 1873 on agricultural land belonging to the Edwardes family. It is primarily made up of stuccoed terraced houses with Italianate dressings but also contains properties in the Jacobean and Second Empire styles as well as a number of purpose built apartment blocks.
Notable former inhabitants include the choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton, Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd, and the ordnance inventor Sir William Palliser. At the Poetry Bookshop in the Square, conventional and modernist factions engaged in the "Battle of Earl's Court" in the 1970s.
