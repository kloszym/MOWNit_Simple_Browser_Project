== Plot ==
Travel agent Paul Barnell finds a body in a dumpster that, unbeknownst to him, was left there by professional hitmen. Heavily in debt and attempting to find a cure for his wife Margaret's apparent Tourette syndrome, he stages a disfiguring animal attack of the body to cash in his missing brother's life-insurance policy, for which a corpse is required.
Local police are convinced that the corpse is Raymond Barnell, but promotion-hungry insurance agent Ted Waters is not. The hitmen who dumped the body are also in search of the corpse for proof to collect their payment. They take Margaret hostage to ensure that they will get the body. Meanwhile, Ted is having problems with his girlfriend Tiffany, who he neglects as he works his way up in his firm.
Paul's missing brother Raymond returns home, beats him up...
