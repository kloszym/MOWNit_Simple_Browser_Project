== History ==
The stadium was opened on 12 February 1981 in a friendly match between Deportivo Español and Spanish club Deportivo La Coruña, won by the local team 1–0. Originally named "Estadio España", it had a capacity for 18,000 people. Entrepreneur Francisco Ríos Seoane was president of the club in those times.
After Deportivo Español promoted to Primera División in 1984 because of winning the Primera B championship, the club decided to refurbish the stadium. Nevertheless it was not until 12 October 1996 (commemorating the 40th. anniversary of club's foundation) that the stadium was reinaugurated with a match between the 1966 team, champion of Torneo Reducido and 1984 Primera B champion team. Works included the expansion of the venue (up to 32,500 spectators) and the installation of a lighting system, being renamed "Estadio Nueva España". Thus, the stadium became one of the biggest venues in the city of Buenos Aires...
