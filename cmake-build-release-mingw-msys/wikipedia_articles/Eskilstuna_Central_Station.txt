== History ==

Eskilstuna Railway Station was inaugurated in 1877, coinciding with the opening of the Oxelösund–Flen–Eskilstuna Railway, which connected the city to Valskog and Kolbäck in Västmanland.
The original station building was completed in 1876. In 1895, the opening of the Norra Sörmland Railway led to the renaming of OFWJ's station to Eskilstuna Central Station. The station underwent significant renovations in 1924, giving it its present appearance. The architectural design was done by Adolf W. Edelsvärd, who was responsible for many Swedish railway stations.
During the 20th century, Eskilstuna Central Station played a  role in the industrial development of the city, facilitating the transport of goods and workers. In recent years, efforts have been made to modernise the station while preserving its historical significance.
