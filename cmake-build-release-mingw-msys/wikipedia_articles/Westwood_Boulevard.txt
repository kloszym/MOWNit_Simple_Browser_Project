== Route ==

Westwood Boulevard begins south of Sunset Boulevard in the campus of UCLA as Westwood Plaza. After exiting UCLA, it is one of two major thoroughfares in Westwood Village. Its intersection with Wilshire Boulevard is one of the busiest in Los Angeles, with seven through lanes and four left turn lanes (going east/west). Most of the large office buildings in Westwood are located on Wilshire Boulevard.
South of Wilshire, Westwood Boulevard continues as a four-lane boulevard passing through many small businesses. This area of Westwood south of Wilshire Boulevard is often referred to as Tehrangeles because of its large Iranian-American population. Many of the businesses along Westwood Boulevard are Persian, reflecting these demographics. In particular, Westwood Boulevard is noted for a large number of Persian restaurants. Farther south, the Westside Pavilion Mall was formerly located at Westwood Boulevard's intersection with Pico Boulevard.
Westwood Boulevard ends south of National Boulevard in the Palms neighborhood of Los Angeles, as it curves...
