The Antiphon (1958) is a three-act verse tragedy by Djuna Barnes. Set in England in 1939 after the beginning of World War Two, the drama presents the Hobbs family reunion in the family's ancestral home, Burley Hall. The play features many of the themes or motifs that run through Barnes's work, including betrayal, familial relations, regression and transgression. The dialogue is highly stylized and poetic.
The play premiered in 1961 in Stockholm in a Swedish translation by Karl Ragnar Gierow and U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. Despite the fact that Barnes continued to write until her death in 1983, it was the last of her major works to be published. Although it was not as successful as Nightwood, Barnes considered it her most important work.
