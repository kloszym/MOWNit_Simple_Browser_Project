Yewbarrow is a fell, in the English Lake District, which lies immediately north of the head of Wast Water. It is 628 metres (2,060 feet) high and in shape resembles the upturned hull of a boat or a barrow. Yewbarrow is on the left in the classic view of Great Gable and Wast Water.
The top of Stirrup Crag forms a second summit 616 metres (2,021 feet) high, one-half mile (0.80 km) north of the main summit. The Hewitt and Nuttall lists classify the Yewbarrow North Top as a separate summit.
The name is derived from the past prevalence of yew trees on the fell and its "barrow" shape.


== Topography ==
The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north-east and Wasdale to the south-east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley. Yewbarrow is an outlier of the southern arm.
The main watershed runs broadly westwards from Great Gable, dividing the headwaters of Ennerdale and Wasdale. Travelling...
