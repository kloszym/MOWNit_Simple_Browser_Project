Collectybles is a compilation album by the American Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, released on November 21, 2000. The two disc set includes early demo recordings, live versions and studio tracks, some previously unreleased.
Tracks 2 & 3 of disc 1, "Need all my Friends" and (b/w) "Michelle" were recorded in 1968 and 1969 respectively (ST101 and ST102) intended as a single under the moniker LYNARD SKYNARD, making these the only 2 recordings ever released under a different band name. There were 300 7" vinyl 45rpm singles pressed, although not released until 1970, a year after the band had already permanently settled on the name Lynyrd Skynyrd.
