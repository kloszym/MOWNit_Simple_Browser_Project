UNICEF Philippines is one of  Philippine's offices of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). Being one of the first UNICEF offices established in Asia , it works to uphold the rights of children in the Philippines, including their right to education, healthcare, protection from abuse and exploitation. Additionally, it advocates for political change in support of children, and works with partners from  public and private sectors to create change through sustainable programs .
UNICEF itself was created in 1946 to provide food, clothing, and healthcare to children in Europe after World War II. In 1953, the UN General Assembly extended UNICEF’s mandate. In 1989 it adopted the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which has since become the most widely adopted human rights treaty in history. The CRC now underpins UNICEF’s work around the world, including in the Philippines, and defines children’s rights.
