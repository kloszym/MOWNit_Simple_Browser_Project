In algebra, given a category C with a cotriple, the n-th cotriple homology of an object X in C with coefficients in a functor E is the n-th homotopy group of the E of the augmented simplicial object induced from X by the cotriple. The term "homology" is because in the abelian case, by the Dold–Kan correspondence, the homotopy groups are the homology of the corresponding chain complex.
Example: Let N be a left module over a ring R and let 
  
    
      
        E
        =
        −
        
          ⊗
          
            R
          
        
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle E=-\otimes _{R}N}
  
. Let F be the left adjoint of the forgetful functor from the category of rings to Set; i.e., free module functor. Then 
  
    
      
        F
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle FU}
  
 defines a cotriple and the n-th cotriple homology of 
  
    
      
        E
        (
        F
        
          U
          
            ∗
          
        
        M
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle E(FU_{*}M)}
  
 is the n-th left derived functor of E evaluated at M; i.e., 
  
    
      
        
          Tor
