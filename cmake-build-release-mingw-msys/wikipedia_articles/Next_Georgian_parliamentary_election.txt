The date of the next Georgian parliamentary election is uncertain, depending on the interpretation of the validity of the 2024 Georgian parliamentary election, which was seen as invalid by the Georgian President at the time, Salome Zourabichvili, and by the four main opposition coalitions Coalition for Change, Unity â€“ National Movement, Strong Georgia, and For Georgia.
In late December 2024, Zourabichvili stated that a new election was needed and that the process of preparing a new election would have to be done by 29 December 2024. She invited Georgian Dream (GD) founder Bidzina Ivanishvili to negotiate the procedure. She stated that a council would be created if Ivanishvili refused to negotiate. On 24 December she discussed procedures for a new election with leaders of the four main opposition coalitions and non-governmental organizations. Mikheil Kavelashvili was inaugurated as president on 29 December, with Zourabichvili disputing the constitutional validity of the procedures and stating that she remained the legitimate president.
