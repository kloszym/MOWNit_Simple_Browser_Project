Haminoea is a genus of medium-sized sea snails or bubble snails, marine opisthobranch gastropod molluscs in the family Haminoeidae, the haminoea bubble snails, part of the clade Cephalaspidea, the headshield slugs and bubble snails.


== Systematics ==
Three different spellings (Haminoea, Haminea, Haminaea) were used for this genus over two hundred years. The ICZN finally made a decision that the correct spelling is Haminoea.
Oskars et al. (2019) restricted Haminoea to species from the Atlantic and eastern Pacific, and resurrected Haloa and Lamprohaminoea for Indo-Pacific species.


== Description ==
Many species within this genus have green algae growing on their shells. The posterior tip of the headshield is bilobed, except in Haminoea elegans.
