The Meritorious Honor Award is an award of the United States Agency for International Development.  Similar versions of the same award exist for the former U.S. Information Agency, Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and Department of State.  It is presented to groups or individuals in recognition of a special act or service or sustained outstanding performance. 
The award consists of a certificate signed by an assistant secretary, an official of equivalent rank or the Mission Director. While some medal sets are still available,  medals are no longer issued.
