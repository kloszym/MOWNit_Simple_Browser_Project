The Belgian Banking Commission (French: Commission bancaire) was a Belgian financial supervisory authority created in 1935 in the aftermath of the financial turmoil of the early 1930s. It was later renamed CBF in 1990 (French: Commission bancaire et financière, Dutch: Commissie voor het Bank- en Financiewezen), then CBFA in 2004 (French: Commission Bancaire, Financière et des Assurances, Dutch: Commissie voor het Bank-, Financie- en Assurantiewezen).
The Commission's existence ended in 2011, with its duties were shared between the National Bank of Belgium and the newly established Financial Services and Markets Authority.
