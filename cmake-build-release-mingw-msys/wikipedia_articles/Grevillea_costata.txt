== Description ==
Grevillea costata is a spreading shrub that typically grows to a height of 0.8–1.5 m (2 ft 7 in – 4 ft 11 in) and has many ridged, silky-hairy branchlets. Its leaves are linear, 15–45 mm (0.59–1.77 in) long and 0.8–1.3 mm (0.031–0.051 in) wide with the edges rolled under, enclosing all but the mid-vein. The flowers are arranged in groups of four to ten in leaf axils or on the ends of branchlets and are white, the pistil 7.0–9.5 mm (0.28–0.37 in) long with a white to cream-coloured, sometimes pink style. Flowering occurs from May to September and the fruit is an elliptic to oblong follicle 9.5–11 mm (0.37–0.43 in) long with prominent ridges.

Grevillea costata was first formally described in 1974 by Alex George in the journal Nuytsia from specimens collected by Charles Gardner near rocks in the Murchison River in 1931. The specific epithet (costata) means "ribbed", referring to the fruit.
