Dinky Doodle was a cartoon character created by Walter Lantz for Bray Productions in 1924.


== Description ==
Dinky was a standard boy character, sporting a flat cap, a striped shirt, and dark shorts. He and his dog Weakheart appeared alongside Lantz himself (as the cartoonist) in a series of cartoons that combined live-action and animation, similar in style to Max Fleischer's Out of the Inkwell series. The character of Weakheart, Dinky's pet dog, was based on the 1920s canine film star Strongheart.

The character enjoyed a degree of popularity among audiences, but was retired from the screen in 1926.


== In popular culture ==
The character was mentioned as someone supposedly kidnapped when Angelo mocks Eddie Valiant for working for a toon in the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
