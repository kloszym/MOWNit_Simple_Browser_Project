Abū Dharr ʿAlī (Arabic: أبو ذر علي), also known by the regnal name of Nūr al-Dīn Muḥammad (Arabic: نور الدين محمد), was the 35th imam of the Qasim-Shahi branch of the Nizari Isma'ili community.
He succeeded his father, al-Mustansir Billah III, upon his death in 1498, at Anjudan. He apparently married a sister or daughter of the Safavid shah of Persia, Tahmasp I. Despite this close connection to the rulers of Persia however, the Safavids began to persecute all other varieties of Shi'ism that rivalled their own Twelver creed, and Tahmasp launched a persecution of the Nizaris during the reign of Abu Dharr Ali's son and successor, Murad Mirza.
