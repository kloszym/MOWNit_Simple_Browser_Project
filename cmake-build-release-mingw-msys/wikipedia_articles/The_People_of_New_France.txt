The People of New France (French: Brève histoire des peuples de la Nouvelle-France) is a book of Canadian history during the 17th and 18th centuries written by Allan Greer and published by the University of Toronto Press in 1997 and by Boréal in 1998 for the French version, as part of the Themes in Canadian History series.  Unlike works of history that focus on the political histories of government officials and the clergy, Greer focuses on the day-to-day reality of living in French colonial Canada. One 2007 review of the book describes the treatment as focusing on "... colonial society 'as it was' by examining the 'frameworks of ordinary life' – death, birth, marriage, food, race, class."
