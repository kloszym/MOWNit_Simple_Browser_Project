"The Case of the Stick" (Portuguese: O caso da vara) is an 1891 short story by Brazilian writer Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, published first in the Gazeta de Notícias and republished in the book Páginas Recolhidas. It is an ironic depiction of slavery in Brazil (abolished in 1888) and selfishness. The story's title is sometimes translated into English as "The Punishment Case", or "The Cane"; it appears under the latter in A Chapter of Hats and Other Stories, a collection of Machado's short stories published in Great Britain by Bloomsbury Publishing in 2008.


== Plot summary ==
Damião (pronounced Da-mi-ow) is a young man who escapes from a seminary. Afraid that if he returns home, his father will force him to return to the seminary, he goes to ask help of Miss Rita, a widow and the lover of Damião's godfather, João Carneiro. She agrees to help him, and he hides in her house, where she has a number of girls working for her.
When Rita asks why he does not speak with his father, Damião tells Rita that his father does not listen to anyone. Rita suggests that he seek help from his godfather. At first, Damião resists, but eventually agrees, and João Carneiro is sent for.
