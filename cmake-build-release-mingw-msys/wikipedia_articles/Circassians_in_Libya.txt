Circassians in Libya (Adyghe: Либием ис Адыгэхэр, romanized: Libiyem yis Adıgəxər) refers to the Circassian diaspora settled in Libya, numbering about 30,000 today. They live mainly in Misrata and Benghazi. They have been integrated into Libyan society and are mostly Arabised.

Unlike the majority other Circassian diasporas in the Middle East, the Libyan Circassians are not descendants of the Circassians exiled during the Circassian genocide, but are descendants of the Circassian Mamluks who served in the armies of the Arab caliphs since the 9th century. The traditions among Libyan Circassians have mostly been Arabised.
