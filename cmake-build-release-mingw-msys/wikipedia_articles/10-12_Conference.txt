The 10-12 Conference is a former high school athletic conference located in western Wisconsin. It was a relatively short-lived organization, competing from 1946 to 1948 and its member schools were affiliated with the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association.


== History ==

The 10-12 Conference was formed in 1946 by four small high schools in western Wisconsin: Eleva, Fairchild, Humbird and Strum. The conference was named after two highways that were located within its geographic footprint (U.S. Route 10 and U.S. Route 12), and member schools were located in Clark, Eau Claire and Trempealeau Counties. In 1948, the school districts in Eleva and Strum merged, and Central Union High School of Eleva-Strum was opened in Strum shortly afterwards. The decrease in members to three led to the demise of the 10-12 Conference, only two years after it was originally founded. Eleva-Strum and Fairchild both became members of the Trempealeau Valley Conference in later years (Fairchild in 1949, Eleva-Strum in 1952), and Humbird competed as an independent for its final year of existence before consolidation with Alma Center and Merrillan into Lincoln High School in Alma Center.
