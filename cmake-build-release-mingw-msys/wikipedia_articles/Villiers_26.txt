The Villiers 26 was a French naval seaplane which used Handley Page slats to provide the wide speed range required for escort and patrol duties. It was tested, behaved satisfactorily but received no production order.

The 1928 Villiers XXIV nightfighter was the first French aircraft to use Handley Page slats and Viliers used them again in a slightly different way on their Type 26.  They provided the low speeds required for efficient ship escort work as well as high speeds for patrols, as well as almost halving the takeoff time.
Apart from a narrowed centre-section, the wings were strictly rectangular in plan, with a chord of 3.20 m (10 ft 6 in).  Mounted on the lower fuselage with about 4° of dihedral, they were built around two box spars with spruce ribs and fabric covered. Each wing was braced from the floats by converging pairs of duralumin tubular struts to the spars at a little beyond mid-span. The leading and trailing edges of both wings were filled by duralumin-covered control surfaces, divided into two matching sections.  On the outer wing, the ailerons had slats which were opened automatically by aerodynamic forces when the angle of incidence exceeded 8°; the inner...
