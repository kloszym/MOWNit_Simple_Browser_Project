== Reception ==

Music critic Alexey Eremenko, in his Allmusic wrote "Little Bird is more old school, as it peppers the pop hits with honest to God country numbers, complete with banjo and fiddle... With Chambers, the music and the words sometimes tether on the brink of cliché, not archetype. But for the most part, she is still able to deliver her tunes with honesty that makes you think about feelings she's conveying, not her recording budgets, as is the case with many over-processed country stars out there."
