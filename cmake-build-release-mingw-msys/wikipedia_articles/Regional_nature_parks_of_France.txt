A regional nature park or regional natural park (French: parc naturel régional or PNR) is a public establishment in France between local authorities and the French national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty in order to protect the scenery and heritage as well as set up sustainable economic development in the area.
A PNR sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation, sustainable economic development, and the protection of the natural environment based on each park's unique landscape and heritage. The parks also foster ecological research programs and public education in the natural sciences.
As of 2024, there are 58 PNRs. These account for 15% of all French territory, over 7,000,000 hectares (17,000,000 acres). The parks encompass over 4,200 communes with more than three million inhabitants. The PNR system was created by a decree of March 1, 1967. The territory covered by each PNR is decided by the French Prime Minister and is reexamined every 12 years.
