== Early life ==
Maniapoto was born in Invercargill, New Zealand, and attended St Joseph's Māori Girls' College in Napier. She completed her secondary school education at McKillop College, Rotorua. She is said to have paid her way through Auckland law school by singing covers in the highly competitive Auckland club circuit. Maniapoto was raised Roman Catholic, with her cousin Max Mariu being the first Māori bishop. However during her college years Maniapoto began to question her Catholic beliefs, and abandoned them entirely after the birth of her children. She now considers herself a follower of traditional Māori spirituality.
