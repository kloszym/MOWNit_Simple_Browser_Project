A chicken harvester is a machine used in poultry farming to gather chickens (typically broilers) for slaughter.


== Description and function ==
Since broilers are not kept in cages, some method is required to catch the chickens. The traditional hand method was to corral the birds, catch them, grab them by the feet, five per hand (typically), and then drop the animals into crates. This is a backbreaking job, said to be "the worst in the poultry industry".
The chicken harvester machines, by contrast, use different systems to collect and deposit the chickens onto a conveyor belt which then moves and cage them into crates or containers, to transfer them to subsequent processing. Chicken harvesters can harvest from 18 up to 26 tons of birds per hour (about 8000 birds per hour â€“ average bird weight 2,5 kg).
Studies have demonstrated that the use of chicken harvesters may be less stressful to the birds compared to being hand-wrangled by humans. The use of the machines has also been demonstrated to reduce injuries to chickens compared to those that occur from hand-wrangling, especially in wings and legs. In addition, while the machine does not reduce the number of man hours required to process...
