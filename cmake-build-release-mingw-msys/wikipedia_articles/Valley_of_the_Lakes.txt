The Valley of the Lakes (Mongolian: Нууруудын хөндий) is an intermontane depression located in southwestern Mongolia, separating the Khangai and Govi-Altai mountains.

Along the valley floor lies a chain of large and small saline lakes, which are generally shallow, with a saucer-shaped depth profile. The largest of these lakes are Böön Tsagaan Lake and Orog Lake.
