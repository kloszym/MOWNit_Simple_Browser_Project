Sir Walter George Salis Schwabe  (3 March 1873 – 20 April 1931) was a British barrister and Chief Justice of the Madras High Court from 1921 to 1924.
Schwabe was the second son of Liberal politician Maj.-Gen. George Salis Schwabe, C.B., by his wife Mary Jacqueline, daughter of Sir William Milbourne James, Lord Justice of Appeal in 1870. His paternal grandfather, Salis (born Solomon ben Elias) Schwabe (1800–1853), of Crumpsall House, Manchester, and Glyn Garth, Anglesey, formerly of Rhodes House, Middleton, was a successful calico printer of Jewish origin who was born in Ovelgönne (near Oldenburg), first settled in Glasgow in 1817, then moved to Rhodes (near Manchester) in 1832 and converted to the Anglican Church, ten years later to Unitarianism. He married his cousin Julie Schwabe, who became a noted educationist.
Educated at Cheltenham College, Marlborough College and Trinity College, Oxford (B.A. 1894), Schwabe was called to the Bar from the Inner Temple 26 January 1897, and entered the Northern Circuit. He was appointed King's Counsel in 1913. He was joint author of Schwabe and Branson's Law of the Stock Exchange and Effect of War on Stock Exchange.
