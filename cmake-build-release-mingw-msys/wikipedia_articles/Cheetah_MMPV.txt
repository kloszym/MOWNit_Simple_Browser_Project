The Cheetah MMPV (Medium Mine Protected Vehicle) was a prototype built by the Force Protection, Inc., division of General Dynamics. It was intended as part of Force Protection's armoured military vehicle line-up, which includes the MRAP-class of Buffalo and Cougar vehicles and the Ocelot light protected patrol vehicle (LPPV).
Its design was based on the South African RG-31 Charger class of light-armored vehicle, intended as a reconnaissance, forward command and control, and urban operations vehicle for homeland security missions.
No contracts were procured for the Cheetah MMPV, and production ended in 2008 after 13 prototypes had been manufactured.
