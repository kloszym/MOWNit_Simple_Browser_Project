Elin Andersdotter (died 1569), was a Swedish courtier. She served as Chief Court Mistress to queen Karin Månsdotter of Sweden. She is known for being a leading actor in the 1569 Plot to free and reinstate the imprisoned and deposed king Erik XIV of Sweden.


== Life ==
Elin Andersdotter was reportedly the widow of a certain Gerdt Svärdfejare from Vadstena, and remarried at an unknown time to a man by the name Hans Andersson. She is first mentioned as a part of the staff of the royal mistress Karin Månsdotter in 1566. Described as a loyal servant, she received several gifts from Karin.
When Karin Månsdotter became queen, Elin Andersdotter was named mistress of the Robes. This was an unusual position for a commoner, but the court appointed to Karin Månsdotter, herself originally a commoner, when she became queen, was quite small, smaller than those of her royal sisters-in-law, and mainly consisting of her former staff of commoners. Initially, the noblewoman Marina Grip had been appointed to the position, but she had stayed only temporary.
In 1568, Erik XIV was deposed and imprisoned alongside Karin Månsdotter, who was however allowed to keep her staff.
