General Stanisław Zarakowski (7 November 1907 – 11 April 1998) was a chief military prosecutor in the People's Republic of Poland who was famous for his role in several trials of Polish Underground State officers which resulted in many death sentences.
Zarakowski was born to a local landowner in Svolna village (Belarusian: Свольна) in Vilna Governorate (Russian Empire, present-day Belarus). His family's estate was nationalized during the Bolshevik revolution when he was ten years old. They moved to Vilnius, where Zarakowski graduated from the law faculty of the Wilno University (then in the Second Polish Republic).

A hardline Stalinist, Zarakowski was assigned a job with the Chief Military Prosecutor Office and quickly rose to become the Chief Military Prosecutor of the People's Republic of Poland.
