== Career ==
Stevens had parts in some TV shows before and after he portrayed Larry Mondello in the sitcom Leave It to Beaver. Reportedly, he left the show in 1960 because his family moved from Burbank, California, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; however, Barbara Billingsley, who played June Cleaver on the series, said in a TV Archive interview that Stevens was fired because his overbearing stage mother caused grief for the producers of the series. After Leave It to Beaver, Stevens continued to get occasional roles in California-shot TV shows through 1963 (including My Three Sons, Perry Mason and The Rifleman), before his career as a child actor came to a close.
He briefly returned to acting when he reprised his role as Larry Mondello in the 1983 made-for-television reunion movie Still the Beaver. He also appeared in three episodes of the follow-up series The New Leave It to Beaver through 1989.
