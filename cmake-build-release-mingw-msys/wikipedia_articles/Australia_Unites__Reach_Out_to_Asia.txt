Australia Unites: Reach Out to Asia was a telethon held in Australia on 8 January 2005. The telethon raised money for World Vision, as a part of the humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. It was telecast on the three commercial television networks (the Seven Network, the Nine Network and Network Ten, by ABC Asia Pacific and through regional stations as well). It was the first time all three television networks produced a telethon as a unit. It was also simulcast on the Triple M network, Mix 94.5 Perth, ARN (Mix and Classic Hits), and Nova stations.
