Valinhos is a countryside place on the outskirts of Fátima, Portugal. This place became famous for the 19 August 1917 apparition of Our Lady of Fátima and by the 1st and 3rd apparitions of the Guardian Angel of Portugal (also named the Angel of Peace). As such, it is a popular site for religious tourism.


== Points of interest ==
In Valinhos, there are points of interest such as the Via Sacra or Caminho dos Pastorinhos (path of the little shepherds), which takes pilgrims along 14 chapels that represent the different stations of the Way of the Cross. The Via Sacra begins at Rotunda Sul and ends at the Hungarian Calvary (Calvário Húngaro), where there is a chapel dedicated to St. Stephen. 14 of the 15 stations were donated by Hungarian refugees.
Between the 8th and 9th station of the Via Sacra, there is the place where the fourth apparition of Our Lady, on August 19, 1917, is said to have occurred. The Loca do Anjo is the place where the apparitions of the Angel to the visionaries are said to have taken place; a sculpture now marks the spot.
