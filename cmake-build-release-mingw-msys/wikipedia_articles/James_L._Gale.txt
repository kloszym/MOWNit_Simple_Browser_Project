In March 2011, Gale was appointed by North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue to serve on North Carolina's Business Court, as a Special Superior Court Judge for Complex Business Cases. This is a specialized business court docket of limited jurisdiction within the North Carolina Superior Court, that primarily hears cases "involving complex and significant issues of corporate and commercial law." Gale's 35 years of private legal practice as a lawyer before being appointed as a business court judge included a focus on complex business and commercial disputes.

Gale retired in 2021, being succeeded by Judge Julianna Threall Earp.
