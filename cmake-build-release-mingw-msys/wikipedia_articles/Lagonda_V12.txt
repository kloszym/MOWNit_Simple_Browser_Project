The Lagonda V12 is a large car produced by the British Lagonda company from 1938 until 1940. It was first shown at the 1936 London Motor Show but production did not commence until 1938.
The V12 model featured an all new 4480 cc 60 degree V12 engine designed during the tenure of W. O. Bentley at Lagonda. The design concepts of the engine follow those established by Stewart Tresilian during his time at Rolls Royce and it seems likely that Tresilian who followed W O Bentley from RR to Lagonda was responsible for its design. The engine has a combined cylinder block and upper crankcase cast in iron with a light alloy lower crankcase. The cylinder heads are cast iron. Each bank of six cylinders has its own single overhead camshaft, chain driven, and its own distributor driven from the back of the camshaft. Twin downdraught SU carburettors are located between the engine blocks. 180 hp (134 kW) is developed at 5000rpm.
The chassis was also new and features independent torsion bar front suspension and live rear axle with hypoid final drive. The braking system is Lockheed hydraulic.
The engine is connected to a four-speed gearbox with centrally mounted change lever.
