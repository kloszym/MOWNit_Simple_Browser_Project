The 1957 Arlington State Rebels football team was an American football team that represented Arlington State College (now known as the University of Texas at Arlington) as a member of the Pioneer Conference (PC) during the 1957 junior college football season. In their fifth year under head coach Chena Gilstrap, the team compiled a perfect 12–0 record, won the PC championship, held 10 opponents to seven points or less, and outscored all opponents by a total of 425 to 62. They also played in the Junior Rose Bowl for the second consecutive year, defeating Cerritos College, 21–12, to claim the junior college national championship.
Arlington led the PC in both total offense (349 yards per game) and total defense (159 yards per game). Arlington's Justin Rowland was the leading pass receiver in the conference, and halfback Kenny Williams was the leading scorer.
The Rebels played their home games at Memorial Stadium in Arlington, Texas.
