Bonython Park is a 17-hectare park in the north-west Park Lands of the South Australian capital of Adelaide. The park was opened in 1962 and named in honour of prominent South Australian politician and journalist, Sir John Langdon Bonython. It is situated on the north-western side of the River Torrens, bordered by Port Road. It is on the opposite side of the river to a golf course, and adjacent to the old Adelaide Gaol and the Police Barracks.
Bonython Park forms part of what is known as Park 27, and since the dual naming initiative by Adelaide City Council in the early 2000s, Park 27 is also known as Tulya Wardli. There are sites straddling this park and Park 1/ Pirltawardli of some significance to the Kaurna people, since various "native locations" were established on the sites dating from 1837, when the first settlers arrived and the establishment of a Christian mission in the following year.
