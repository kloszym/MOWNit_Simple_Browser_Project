The Xiamen Marathon (Chinese: 厦门马拉松; pinyin: Xiàmén guójì mǎlāsōng sài; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Ē-mn̂g kok-chè má-la-song sài) is a Platinum Label marathon event held annually on the Xiamen in Fujian, People's Republic of China.

== History ==
The Xiamen International Marathon, which began in 2003 and is deemed by the IAAF as a Gold Label Road Race, is famous for its coastal scenic course. The entire course follows the scenic sections of the coastal city. The 2010 edition of the race had at least 30 instances of cheating, with some runners carrying multiple timing sensors or using public transport mid-course. Judges believed this was due to students attempting to gain bonus points for their National Higher Education Entrance Examinations.
