In mathematics, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, also called the unique factorization theorem and prime factorization theorem, states that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors. For example,

  
    
      
        1200
        =
        
          2
          
            4
          
        
        ⋅
        
          3
          
            1
          
        
        ⋅
        
          5
          
            2
          
        
        =
        (
        2
        ⋅
        2
        ⋅
        2
        ⋅
        2
        )
        ⋅
        3
        ⋅
        (
        5
        ⋅
        5
        )
        =
        5
        ⋅
        2
        ⋅
        5
        ⋅
        2
        ⋅
        3
        ⋅
        2
        ⋅
        2
        =
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1200=2^{4}\cdot 3^{1}\cdot 5^{2}=(2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2)\cdot 3\cdot (5\cdot 5)=5\cdot 2\cdot 5\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 2=\ldots }
  

The theorem says two things about this example: first, that 1200 can be represented as a product of primes, and second, that no matter how this is done, there...
