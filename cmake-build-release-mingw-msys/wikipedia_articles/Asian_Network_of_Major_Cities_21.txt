Asian Network of Major Cities 21 was a body representing the interests of several of Asia's largest capital cities around common themes of importance, including urban planning, sustainability and crisis management. The organization was advocated by then Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara (1999â€“2012) and formed by common declaration of those attending a meeting held in Kuala Lumpur in August 2000. Following a review by member cities in 2014, the network was suspended and projects continued under new regional initiatives by Tokyo.
