Wanderers Special Club (often abbreviated as Wanderers SC) were a football club based in Auckland, New Zealand.


== Club overview ==
The team was age-restricted, and featured only players below 20 years of age. The club was formed to develop players for the New Zealand national under-20 football team in preparation for the then up-coming 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup, hosted in New Zealand. New Zealand Football High Performance Director Fred de Jong said that "one of the objectives is to retain our top young players in New Zealand for longer, and entry into the ASB Premiership gives us an opportunity to prepare in a cost effective manner when compared to touring the team internationally."
The club is considered to be a continuation of Northern-Based, an under-17 team that played in the ASB Youth League and provided several players to New Zealand for the 2013 OFC U-17 Championship.
The team entered the 2013–14 ASB Premiership season, replacing outgoing YoungHeart Manawatu.
The team was withdrawn from the ASB Premiership following the completion of the 2014–15 season.
