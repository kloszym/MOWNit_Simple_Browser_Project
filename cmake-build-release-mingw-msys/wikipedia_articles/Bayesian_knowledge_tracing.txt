Bayesian knowledge tracing is an algorithm used in many intelligent tutoring systems to model each learner's mastery of the knowledge being tutored.
It models student knowledge in a hidden Markov model as a latent variable, updated by observing the correctness of each student's interaction in which they apply the skill in question.
BKT assumes that student knowledge is represented as a set of binary variables, one per skill, where the skill is either mastered
by the student or not. Observations in BKT are also binary: a student gets a problem/step either right or wrong.
Intelligent tutoring systems often use BKT for mastery learning and problem sequencing. In its most common
implementation, BKT has only skill-specific parameters.


== Method ==
There are four model parameters used in BKT:

  
    
      
        p
        (
        
          L
          
            0
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(L_{0})}
  
 or 
  
    
      
        p
        
          -init
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p{\text{-init}}}
  
, the probability of the student knowing the skill beforehand.
