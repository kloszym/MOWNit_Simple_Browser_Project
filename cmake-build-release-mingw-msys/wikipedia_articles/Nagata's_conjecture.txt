In algebra, Nagata's conjecture states that Nagata's automorphism of the polynomial ring k[x,y,z] is wild. The conjecture was proposed by Nagata (1972) and proved by Ualbai U. Umirbaev and Ivan P. Shestakov (2004).
Nagata's automorphism is given by

  
    
      
        ϕ
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        z
        )
        =
        (
        x
        −
        2
        Δ
        y
        −
        
          Δ
          
            2
          
        
        z
        ,
        y
        +
        Δ
        z
        ,
        z
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi (x,y,z)=(x-2\Delta y-\Delta ^{2}z,y+\Delta z,z),}
  

where 
  
    
      
        Δ
        =
        x
        z
        +
        
          y
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta =xz+y^{2}}
  
.
For the inverse, let 
  
    
      
        (
        a
        ,
        b
        ,
        c
        )
        =
        ϕ
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a,b,c)=\phi (x,y,z)}
  

Then 
  
    
      
        z
        =
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle...
