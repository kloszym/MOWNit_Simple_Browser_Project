In mathematics, a permutation polynomial (for a given ring) is a polynomial that acts as a permutation of the elements of the ring, i.e. the map 
  
    
      
        x
        ↦
        g
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\mapsto g(x)}
  
 is a bijection.  In case the ring is a finite field, the Dickson polynomials, which are closely related to the Chebyshev polynomials, provide examples.

Over a finite field, every function, so in particular every permutation of the elements of that field, can be written as a polynomial function.
In the case of finite rings Z/nZ, such polynomials have also been studied and applied in the interleaver component of error detection and correction algorithms.


== Single variable permutation polynomials over finite fields ==
Let Fq = GF(q) be the finite field of characteristic p, that is, the field having q elements where q = pe for some prime p. A polynomial f with coefficients in Fq (symbolically written as f ∈ Fq[x]) is a permutation polynomial of Fq if the function from Fq to itself defined by

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\mapsto f(c)}
  
 is...
