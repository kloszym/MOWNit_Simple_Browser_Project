== Fauna ==
There is a large concentration of Fauna in and around the reserve. The over 347 species of bird that live in the reserve make Birdwatching very popular attraction. Limoncocha also holds a large number of tortoises and a diverse population of fish.

The park is a largely water environment so a large portion of the Flora in the Nature reserve is either aquatic or semi-aquatic in nature. As with much of Ecuador towering trees provide homes for hundreds of types of animals. The microscopic algae in the water gives it a lemon green color.
