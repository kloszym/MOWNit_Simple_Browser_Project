Timothy Graham Quy ( KWY; 14 August 1961 â€“ 2 February 2023) was a British musician, best known as the percussionist for the rock band Cardiacs from 1981 to 1990. Initially the band's sound engineer, Quy first gigged as reserve bass player in 1980 and joined full-time on percussion in 1981. He became a key part of the band's classic six-piece lineup, performing on all their releases from The Seaside (1983) to On Land and in the Sea (1989), and was a popular face in the UK underground. Quy's last performance with Cardiacs was documented in the live video All That Glitters Is a Mares Nest (1992), where his marimba figures particularly high in the mix.
From 2020, several crowdfunding campaigns were created to help Quy through a series of health problems. In 2023, it was announced that Quy had died, prompting reactions from music outlets and Cardiacs members. For 2024 Cardiacs performances, Craig Fortnam of North Sea Radio Orchestra took over Quy's role as percussionist and covers his parts.
