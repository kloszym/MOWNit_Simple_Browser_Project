Legal Marxism was a Russian Marxist movement based on a particular interpretation of Marxist theory whose proponents were active in socialist circles between 1894 and 1901. The movement's primary theoreticians were Pyotr Struve, Nikolai Berdyaev, Sergei Bulgakov, Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky and Semyon Frank. The name was derived from the fact that its supporters promoted their ideas in legal publications.

As Struve put it, they provided a "justification for capitalism" in Russia.
Legal Marxists held numerous open debates from the mid-1890s through the early 1900s, notably at the Free Economic Society in Saint Petersburg, and published three magazines between 1897 and 1901, all of them eventually suppressed by the imperial government:

Novoye Slovo (1897)
Nachalo (1899)
Zhizn (1899â€“1901, resumed abroad in 1902)
Legal Marxists became particularly influential after the arrest and imprisonment...
