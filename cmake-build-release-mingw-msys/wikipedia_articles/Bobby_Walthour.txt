Robert Howe Walthour Sr. (1 January 1878 – 1 September 1949) was one of the best American professional cyclists of his era.


== Career summary ==
Bobby Walthour started his career as a sprinter and developed into a formidable six-day rider, but achieved his greatest fame as a fearless motor-pacer. Walthour turned professional in 1896. He won America’s greatest race, the six-day race inside Madison Square Garden, with his partner, Canadian Archie McEachern, in 1901.

== Beginnings ==
Walthour learned to ride a bike in the early 1890s just about the time when the safety bicycle, the one we are most familiar with today, replaced the cumbersome high-wheeled bicycle. Walthour became employed in Atlanta, Georgia as a bike messenger and showed a great aptitude on the bicycle. Walthour began his amateur career in 1895 in road races in and around Atlanta.
