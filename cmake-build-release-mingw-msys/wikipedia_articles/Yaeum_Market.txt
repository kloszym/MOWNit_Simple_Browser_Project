Yaeum Market (Korean: 야음시장) is a traditional street market in Nam District, Ulsan, South Korea.

The market is also home to many small restaurants and street food stalls.


== Renovations ==
Due to the emergence of large discount stores in Ulsan, the city government began a market-revival initiative in the mid-2000s to improve the infrastructure around Ulsan's traditional markets, while attempting to maintain their traditional atmosphere. The renovations for Yaeum Market completed in October 2005 and included the installation of a 300-meter long, 8 m wide arcade to keep shoppers dry in rainy weather. The cost of the project was KRW317,000,000 (US$317,000 in 2005).
