Kembangan MRT station is an above-ground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the East–West Line in Bedok, Singapore. Operated by SMRT Trains, the station serves the eponymous Kembangan subzone of Bedok. Other nearby landmarks include the Kembangan Community Club (Kembangan CC) and the Masjid Kassim. 
First announced in May 1982 as Frankel station, it was to be constructed as part of Phase II of the MRT system. The name was later changed in 1983. To construct the station, Kampongs Kembangan and Pachitan were acquired. It commenced operations on 17 December 1988 along with the other stations on the Tanah Merah–Pasir Ris stations stretch. Half-height platform screen doors and high-volume low-speed fans were installed by August 2011 and the first quarter of 2013, respectively. Noise barriers were installed by 2018.
Like other stations of the Tanah Merah–Pasir Ris stretch, the station has a domed roof design. As a part of a heritage-themed art exhibition, there are two murals by students from St. Joseph's Institution displayed in the station, which details the history of landmarks near the station.
