The Sign of the Ram is a 1948 American film noir directed by John Sturges and screenplay by Charles Bennett, based on a novel written by Margaret Ferguson. The drama features Susan Peters, Alexander Knox and Phyllis Thaxter. It also featured Ron Randell.  The film's title alludes to people born under the astrological sign Aries (the Ram), who are supposedly strong-willed and desire to be admired, as explained in the dialogue.
The film marked Susan Peters's return to the screen after a three-year absence following an accident that permanently paralyzed her. It was her final film before her death in 1952. It was also the next to last film for Dame May Whitty.
