Landslide is an album by American jazz saxophonist Dexter Gordon featuring recordings from 1961 and 1962 which was first released on the Blue Note label in 1980 as part of the Blue Note Classics series.


== Reception ==

The Allmusic review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated: "Landslide is comprised of previously unreleased material from three separate Dexter Gordon-led sessions between May 1961 and June 1962. ... All three sessions hold together fairly well, and although nothing on the record qualifies as a masterpiece, nothing is bad, either. In comparison to the released sessions, this material may pale somewhat, but it remains first-rate hard bop and is recommended to Gordon collectors".
