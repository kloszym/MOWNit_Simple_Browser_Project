Tasku beacon tower (Taskun pooki in Finnish) is a daymark tower located on the island of Tasku (Pocket in English) in the Raahe archipelago in the Gulf of Bothnia in Finland. The structure was built in 1853 from the plans drawn by Albin Stjerncreutz. In 1983 the Finnish Maritime Administration handed it over to the City of Raahe. Currently the city is responsible of the upkeep of this historical aid to navigation. The Tasku beacon tower is one of three historical beacon towers in Raahe archipelago, however only two beacon towers remain: the second one is the Iso-Kraaseli beacon tower.
