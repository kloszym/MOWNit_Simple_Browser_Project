Danot (Somali: Daanood) is one of the woredas in the Somali Region of Ethiopia, named after its major town, Danot. Part of the Werder Zone, Danot is bordered on the south by Werder, on the west by the Korahe Zone, on the northwest by the Degehabur Zone, on the north by Somaliland, on the east by Boh, and on the southeast by Galadi.


== Overview ==
Danot was important locally for its wells, which were used by the nomadic pastoralists with the advent of the dry season. However, the construction of private birkas (underground concrete water tanks) in adjacent woredas, a development which started in the 1950s and later on dramatically increased after the 1970s, offered a solution to the absence of permanent water, and reduced somewhat the importance of these wells. While this encouraged birka owners to further diversify traditional animal husbandry beyond camels and small ruminants into water-dependent cattle, this also increased livestock population in an overpopulated region, putting additional pressure on shrinking resource base.
Danot is exclusively inhabited by the Ibrahim  (sub-clan) of Ogaden, Reer Sheekh Abbayoonis of Geri Koombe, and Reer Cawl of the Muse Ismail and Reer Caynashe...
