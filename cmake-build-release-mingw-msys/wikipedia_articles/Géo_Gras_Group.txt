The Géo Gras Group  was a French resistance movement that played a decisive role during Operation Torch, the British-American invasion of French North Africa during World War II.

Formed October 1940 in Algiers, the group recruited Jews and French Army officers opposed to Vichy France.  When the Allies invaded French North Africa, the Group provided a third of the Resistance fighters during the capture of Algiers.


== Origin and operation ==
The abolition of the Marchandeau Decree on August 16, 1940, allowed the ultra-right French Popular Party led by Jacques Doriot to maintain anti-Semitic unrest in Algiers. The windows of Jewish-owned stores were smashed during the night of 11 September 1940. On 7 October 1940, the Vichy regime rescinded the Crémieux Decree of 1870, a law that gave French citizenship to Algerian Jews. 120,000 Algerian Jews were stripped of their French citizenship and were from then on considered "indigenous Israelites". As such, Jews were excluded them from major public office, the military, and professions in the press, cinema, radio, and theater.
