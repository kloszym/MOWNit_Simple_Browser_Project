== Reception ==
The Age said the production "had excellent sets and dressing, fine technical presentation and the assistance of a strong cast", but felt Brunell "interpreted Hedda in too 'genteel' a fashion."
The critic for the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the play suffered from "adequate rather than generous acting" except for June Brunell in the lead, who was praised. The Age TV critic felt Brunell was "too genteel" in the lead but thought the production had "excellent sets and dressing".
Richard Lane, who did the adaptation, said that Edward Howell as "chilling" as Brack, "it was a character that suited him perfectly."
