== Family and inheritance ==
Katherine FitzGerald was born in August 1660 at Dromana House, Villierstown, County Waterford, Ireland, the only child and heiress of Sir John FitzGerald, Lord of the Decies (died 1664) and Katherine Power (died 22 August 1660), daughter of John Power, 5th Baron Power, of Curraghmore and Ruth Pypho.
The lords of the Decies had managed to keep their lands intact through the Cromwellian settlements. This was due to their Protestant religion, and the marriage of Katherine's aunt, Lettice to Parliamentarian Major Richard Franklyn, who protected the family's interests.
Katherine inherited the entire Dromana estate on 1 March 1664...
