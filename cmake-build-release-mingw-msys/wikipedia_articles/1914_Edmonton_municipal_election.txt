The 1914 municipal election was held December 14, 1914 to elect a mayor and six aldermen to sit on Edmonton City Council and three trustees to sit on each of the public and separate school boards.
There were ten aldermen on city council, but four of the positions were already filled: Joseph Clarke, Rice Sheppard, J. A. Kinney, and Robert Douglas were all elected to two-year terms in 1913 and were still in office. Alexander Campbell had also been elected to a two-year term, but had resigned. Six were elected this year, with at least one having to be elected from the southside.  Accordingly, the top four plus the most popular southside candidate were elected to two-year terms. The fifth-place finisher from the north side of the North Saskatchewan River - W C Mcarthur - was elected to a one-year term to replace Campbell.
There were seven trustees on the public school board, but four of the positions were already filled: Walter Ramsey, Samuel Barnes, A E May, and J S Hill had been elected to two-year terms in 1913.  The same was true of the separate board, where D J Gilmurray, J O'Neill, Joseph Henri Picard, and E P O'Donnell were continuing.
