3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid kinase (EC 2.7.1.166, kdkA (gene), Kdo kinase) is an enzyme with systematic name ATP:(KDO)-lipid IVA 3-deoxy-alpha-D-manno-oct-2-ulopyranose 4-phosphotransferase. This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

alpha-Kdo-(2->6)-lipid IVA + ATP 
  
    
      
        â‡Œ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }
  
 4-O-phospho-alpha-Kdo-(2->6)-lipid IVA + ADP
The enzyme phosphorylates the 4-OH position of KDO in (KDO)-lipid IVA.
