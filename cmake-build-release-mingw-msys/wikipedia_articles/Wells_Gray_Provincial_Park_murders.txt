The Wells Gray Provincial Park murders was the mass murder of a family of six, committed by David Shearing in August 1982 while the family was camping in the Clearwater Valley near Wells Gray Provincial Park, about 120 km (74.6 mi) north of Kamloops in British Columbia.

The story was featured as Episode 1 of the CBC television series The Detectives in 2018.
