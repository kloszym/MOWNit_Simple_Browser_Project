Simonetta da Collevecchio (Collevecchio â€“ fl. 1534) was a domestic servant of Alfonsina Orsini, wife of Piero the Unfortunate. She was the mother of Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence by either Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino or Pope Clement VII, and has been the subject of several unfounded speculations regarding the parenthood and possible racial origin of her son.  


== Life ==
Born in the peasantry in Collevecchio in Sabina, Simonetta was employed as a maidservant in the household of Alfonsina Orsini in Rome. She is identified as the biological mother of Alessandro de' Medici. 
Alessandro de' Medici was called il Moro because of his dark complexion, and therefore it has been speculated that Simonetta was of African heritage. 
French author Jean Nestor claimed twice in his 1560 book that Alessandro's mother was a Moorish slave.   However, Simonetta was evidently born in the peasantry and employed as a free maidservant, and not a slave, and there is no proof that she was of African heritage. 
It is not verified if Alessandro de' Medici was the son of Simonetta by Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino or by Pope Clement VII; modern historians generally favor the first theory....
