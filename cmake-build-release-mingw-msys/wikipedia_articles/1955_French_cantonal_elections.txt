Cantonal elections to renew the general councillors of cantons were held in France on April 17 and 24, 1955. Originally scheduled for October 1954, the cantonal elections were postponed and finally held in April 1955.

The abstention rate amounted to 40.41%. It was a victory for the moderates and the Rally of Republican Lefts (RGR).
A fairly general progression of the socialists was observed, while the communists retreated in some cantons. In most cases, the socialists allied (withdrawing candidates in favor of the better placed) with center and right-wing parties against the French Communist Party (PCF).
The Popular Republican Movement (MRP) maintained its positions in Western France and Alsace. The Gaullists (Social Republicans) found themselves in difficult positions.

In 13 cantons of HÃ©rault, the election could not take place as the mayors staged a ballot box strike.
