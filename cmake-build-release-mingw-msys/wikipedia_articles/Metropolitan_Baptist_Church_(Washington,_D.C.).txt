== History ==

Rev. Henry Bailey, with ten original members, founded the Fourth Baptist Church in 1864. According to John Wesley Cromwell, the Fourth Baptist Church of Washington D.C., later renamed the Metropolitan Baptist Church, was organized under the guidance of the First Colored Baptist Church of Washington, D.C. which was later renamed the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church. The Metropolitan Baptist Church was located across the street from Camp Barker, which housed a Quaker-run Civil War "contraband" barracks in the Shaw community of Washington, D.C. (then called "Hell's Bottom). It was here, within "Hell's Bottom, that Reverend Bailey and the founders of the Metropolitan Baptist Church began to minister to some 4,000 newly freed slaves. 
Metropolitan holds the distinction of having had only six pastors in its history since 1864: Rev. Henry Bailey (1864–1870); Rev. Robert Johnson (1870–1903); Rev. Moses W. D. Norman (1905–1926); Rev. Earnest Clarence Smith (1928–1977); Rev. H. Beecher Hicks Jr. (1977–2014); Rev. Maurice Watson (2015–2022); and George L. Parks Jr...
