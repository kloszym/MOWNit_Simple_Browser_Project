The 2022–23 Michigan Tech Huskies men's ice hockey season was the 102nd season of play for the program and 5th in the CCHA. The Huskies represented Michigan Technological University in the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, were coached by Joe Shawhan in his 6th season and played their home games at MacInnes Student Ice Arena.

While the Huskies were coming off their best season in 6 years, the team lost a great deal of experience to graduation, including 5 of their top 6 scorers from 2022. As a result, expectations were low for Michigan Tech and the team was hovering around the bottoms of both preseason polls. The lack of offense was not too keenly felt as the Huskies were led by senior netminder, Blake Pietila and he turned in several stellar performances early. In October alone, Pietila earned three  shutouts in non-conference play to stake Tech to a solid national ranking. By November some of the new players were being integrated into the lineup and Tech's offense began to improve. The biggest addition was the team's top prospect, Kyle Kukkonen, who led the Huskies' in goals for the year and was named the CCHA Rookie of the Year.
