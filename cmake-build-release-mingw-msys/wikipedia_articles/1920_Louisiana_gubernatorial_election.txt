The 1920 Louisiana gubernatorial election was held on April 20, 1920.  Like most Southern states between the Reconstruction Era and the Civil Rights Movement, Louisiana's Republican Party had virtually no electoral support. This meant that the Democratic Party primary held on January 20 was the real contest over who would be governor. The election resulted in the election of John M. Parker as governor of Louisiana.
