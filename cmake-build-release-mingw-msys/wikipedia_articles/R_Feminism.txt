In a survey of non–feminists in the subreddit in 2018, non–feminists said that they wanted to disrupt the community. Feminists in the subreddit have noted a level of anti–feminists in the comments. In the first quarter of 2020, about a thousand members were banned from the subreddit per month. Due to disruption, it can be difficult to differentiate good-faith and bad-faith, and feminists within the subreddit may feel uncomfortable voicing their opinions due to negative reactions by other feminists.
