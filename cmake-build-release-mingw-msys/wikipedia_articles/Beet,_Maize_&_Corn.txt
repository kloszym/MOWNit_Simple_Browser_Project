Beet, Maize & Corn is the seventh studio album by London-based musical project The High Llamas, released on 7 October 2003 on Drag City. The style of the album is a notable departure from earlier High Llamas efforts, eschewing all electronic keyboards and effects in favor of a sound dominated by brass and strings.
