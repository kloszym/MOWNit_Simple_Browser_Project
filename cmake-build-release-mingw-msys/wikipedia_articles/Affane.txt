Affane (Irish: Áth Mheáin, meaning 'central ford') is a small village in west County Waterford, Ireland, situated near  Cappoquin and the River Blackwater. The village is in a civil parish of the same name.


== History ==
References to the town of Affane are limited to its inclusion on a list dated 1300 and an incident in 1312, but the presence of a church and castle 300 m apart suggests the presence of a medieval settlement.  The Battle of Affane between the Desmond and Ormonde clans was fought in the area in 1565.
The ruins of a Church of Ireland church are located within a graveyard.  The parish church of Affane, listed as Athmethan and valued at over £6 in the ecclesiastical taxation (1302-1306) was located south of the ruins.  By the mid 16th century it had been united with the church of Dungarvan, but in a visitation of 1588 it was in the Deanery of Ardmore.


== Sport ==
The local Gaelic Athletic Association club is Affane Cappoquin GAA. In 1974, Affane won its only Waterford Senior Football Championship, defeating Dunhill by 1-8 to 0-6, before losing to Austin Stacks in the Munster Senior Club Football Championship.
