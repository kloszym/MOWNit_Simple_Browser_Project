== Reception ==
Steve Leggett of AllMusic rated the album 3.5 out of 5 stars. Scott Bauer of the Associated Press wrote, "While the disc could have used some tasteful editing, maybe cutting down to 12 tracks instead of 16, it's a minor quibble for someone of Seeger's stature. At this point, let the guy release what he wants."
