Marlon Wilson, known professionally as Arlo Maverick, is a Canadian hip-hop artist and filmmaker based in Edmonton, Alberta.


== Personal life ==
Maverick grew up in a working-class family in Edmonton and listened to hip-hop and reggae with his cousins. He first tried penning lyrics at the age of eight when he saw a girl in church who was writing a rhyme rather than listening to the sermon.
Maverick's partner is the painter and filmmaker Natalie Meyer. He works for National Oilwell Varco.

Wilson first adopted the name Arlo Maverick when he and his cousins Dirt Gritie and Bigga Nolte joined his friend DJ Sonny Grimezz to form the hip-hop group Politic Live in 2002. Politic Live toured across Canada and opened for acts like Busta Rhymes, Nas, and Snoop Dogg, but wound down in 2012.
Maverick released his first solo album, Maybe Tomorrow, in 2016. This loosely autobiographical concept album traces the story of a boy named Soup as he comes of age, starts a music career, and deals with life's struggles. It features contributions for many Edmonton-based producers, rappers, and singers. The album hit number-one on the Canadian Campus Radio Weekly Hip-Hop chart for four weeks...
