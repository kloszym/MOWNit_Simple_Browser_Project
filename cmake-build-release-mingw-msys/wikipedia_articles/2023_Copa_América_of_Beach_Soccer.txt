The 2023 Copa América of Beach Soccer (known natively in Spanish as the Copa América de Futbol Playa) was the fourth edition of the Copa América of Beach Soccer, the international beach soccer competition organised by CONMEBOL for the men's national teams of South America. It was held in Rosario, Argentina between 11 and 19 March 2023.
For the first time, the tournament acted as the South American qualification for the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup following CONMEBOL's decision to determine its representatives in the World Cup via the Copa America instead of its specific qualifying tournament that ran until 2021. The top three teams qualified for the 2024 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup held in the United Arab Emirates.
Brazil won their third Copa América Beach Soccer title by beating the hosts Argentina 13–5 in the final. The defending champions Paraguay was unable to retain their title after losing in the semi-finals to Brazil, leading them to play the third place match against Colombia, which they also lost by a 5–7 score. Champions Brazil, runners-up Argentina and third place Colombia qualified for the 2023 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.
