== History ==
The event was formerly held at Phoenix Park, and it used to be classed at Listed level. For a period it was open to horses aged two or older. It was promoted to Group 3 status in 1988, and transferred to Leopardstown in 1991.
The race was moved to the Curragh and upgraded to Group 2 level in 2002. The minimum age of participating horses was raised to three in 2003, and the event reverted to Group 3 status in 2004. It was previously run in late August or early September but from 2014 it was moved to mid-September and became part of the Irish Champions Weekend fixture, switching places in the calendar with the Renaissance Stakes.  It was reinstated as a Group 2 race in 2015 and upgraded to Group 1 status in 2018, when it became the first Group 1 sprint in Ireland open to horses aged three years and older.
