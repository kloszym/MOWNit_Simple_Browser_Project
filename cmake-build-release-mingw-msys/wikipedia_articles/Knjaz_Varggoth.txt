== Biography ==
Yevhen Hapon was born 30 July 1974 in Kharkiv. He is one of the foremost figures in Eastern Europe black metal. Though he has been involved with numerous music projects and bands (Aryan Terrorism, Mistigo Varggoth Darkestra, Lucifugum as a guest musician in 1997, Вече, and more), he is most well known for being the lead vocalist and guitarist for the controversial Ukrainian black metal band Nokturnal Mortum. Nokturnal Mortum gained their reputation performing symphonic black metal with elements of Ukrainian and Slavic folk music and for being a part of the eastern European NSBM scene.
A side project done by Varggoth is the ambient/black metal project Mistigo Varggoth Darkestra, formed in 1994. The most famous album of this project, The Key to the Gates of the Apocalypse, is most likely known particularly due to its long runtime (one 72-minute track) and combination of dark ambient and fast black metal.
