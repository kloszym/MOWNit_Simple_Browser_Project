The Jockey Club de Paris is a traditional gentlemen's club and is regarded as the most prestigious of private clubs in Paris. It is best remembered as a gathering place of the elite of nineteenth-century French society. Today it is decidedly but not exclusively aristocratic. The club seat is at 2, rue Rabelais in Paris, near the Champs-Élysées and it hosts the International Federation of Racing Authorities.
It no longer has official links to the horse-racing industry organisations, which are separate professional bodies.
