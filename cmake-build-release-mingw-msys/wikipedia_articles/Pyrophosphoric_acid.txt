Pyrophosphoric acid, also known as diphosphoric acid, is the inorganic compound with the formula H4P2O7 or, more descriptively, [(HO)2P(O)]2O. Colorless and odorless, it is soluble in water, diethyl ether, and ethyl alcohol. The anhydrous acid crystallizes in two polymorphs, which melt at 54.3 and 71.5 °C. The compound is a component of polyphosphoric acid, an important source of phosphoric acid.  Anions, salts, and esters of pyrophosphoric acid are called pyrophosphates.


== Preparation ==
It can be prepared by reaction of phosphoric acid with phosphoryl chloride:

5 H3PO4  +  POCl3  →  3 H4P2O7  +  3 HCl
It can also be prepared by ion exchange from sodium pyrophosphate or by treating lead pyrophosphate with hydrogen sulfide.
Boiling the water from orthophosphoric acid will not dehydrate it to pure pyrophosphoric acid, instead a mixture of ortho, pyro, and polyphosphoric acids are produced, the maximum pyrophosphoric acid concentration remains below 50% and occurs slightly before what would otherwise be pure pyrophosphoric acid.


== Reactions ==
Pyrophosphoric acid is a tetraprotic acid, with four distinct pKa's:

H4P2O7   ⇌   [H3P2O7]−  + H+, pKa = 0.85
[H3P2O7]−   ⇌   [H2P2O7]2−...
