== History ==
In the early years of Polish statehood, the area of Jasliska probably belonged to the tribe of the Vistulans, which in the late 10th century became part of Poland. For the next centuries, this hilly corner of the kingdom was sparsely inhabited and covered by dense forests. In the mid-14th century, King Kazimierz Wielki decided to found a new town, located in the Jasiolka river valley. On January 28, 1366, in Opatowiec, the King granted Magdeburg rights to a town called Hohstadt (see Walddeutsche). First owner of the town was a Hungarian nobleman, John of Hanselin.
