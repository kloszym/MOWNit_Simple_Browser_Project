== Reception ==
Reviews were very positive.
In response to requests for interviews, Conway's attorney responded that, "Ms Conway does not wish to be associated in any manner with the film."  According to the filmmaker, Penny Chapman,"Ker Conway appeared especially displeased with a sex scene in the film because she believed it: 'turns a lyrical affair into a Peyton Place soap opera of lust'."
