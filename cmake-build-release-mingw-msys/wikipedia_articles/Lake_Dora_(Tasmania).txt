== Features and location ==
It has two adjacent tarns just west of it, Maxfield and Michael Tarns, and numerous unnamed smaller lakes and water features.
The nearest named features are Walford Peak at 1,009 metres (3,310 ft), approximately one kilometre (zero point six two miles) to the north west; and Farquhar Lookout at 935 metres (3,068 ft), located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the south west. It is 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) north north west of Eldon Peak
Located east of the Mount Tyndall area, it was the site of a transient gold-mining rush in the late 1890s. Lake Dora is not generally accessible by road, but only via trails or by helicopter. Lake Dora lies north of Lake Spicer – into which it drains.
Charles Whitham wrote of the mining rush:
Lake Dora, Royal Dora, Lady Dora, North Dora, and, of course Dora Reward. The Government put in a good track from Mount Read, with a telephone line (1897).
