Lapalco is the second album by American singer-songwriter Brendan Benson, released in 2002. The name "Lapalco" is in reference to Lapalco Boulevard, a major highway which runs through Harvey, Louisiana, where Benson spent part of his youth. The street name is an acronym of "Louisiana Power And Light Company", the former name of the power company that owned the right of way to the property that the highway was built on. Cover and design was done by Roe Peterhans and photography by Andy Kemp.
The song "Tiny Spark" featured on an episode from the fourth series of Teachers, as well as in the feature films Along Came Polly, and World's Greatest Dad.
