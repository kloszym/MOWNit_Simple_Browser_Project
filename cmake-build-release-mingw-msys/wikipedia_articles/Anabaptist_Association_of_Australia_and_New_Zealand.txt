The Anabaptist Association of Australia and New Zealand (AAANZ) is a network of individuals from a variety of Christian denominations in Australia and New Zealand who share a common interest in the Anabaptist tradition.
In 1998 the body was incorporated with about 80 members. The association believes that the enduring legacy of the Anabaptists includes: 

baptism upon profession of faith
church membership is voluntary and members are accountable to the Bible (read through the revelation of Jesus) and to each other
commitment to the way of peace and other teachings of Jesus as a rule for life
separation of church and state
worshipping congregations which create authentic community and reach out through vision and service
