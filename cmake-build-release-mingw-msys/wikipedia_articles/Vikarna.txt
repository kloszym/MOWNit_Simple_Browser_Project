In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, Vikarna (Sanskrit: विकर्ण) was the third Kaurava, a son of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, and a brother to the crown prince Duryodhana. Vikarna is also referred to as the most reputable of the Kauravas. Vikarna was the only Kaurava who opposed the humiliation of Draupadi, the wife of his cousins, the Pandavas, after Yudhisthira lost her freedom in a game of dice to Duryodhana.


== Etymology ==

The word Vikarna has two meanings. Basically it is made from two words. First word is vinā (विना) or vishāla (विशाल), while second word is karna (कर्ण. vinā means 'without' and vishāla means 'large'. And karna means 'ears'. So this name contains two meanings. Either it is 'the one who is earless' or 'large eared'. This could say something about his character. It is possible that the name Vikarna basically came from his character of either not listening to anyone(self-esteemed) or who listens and captures wisdom through his (large)ears.
While Karna cheered his friend Duryodhan and encouraged him to disrobe Droupadi, the Vikarna opposed Karna and speaks of righteous behaviour and proper respectful conduct towards women.
Vikarna also means the exact opposite of Karna....
