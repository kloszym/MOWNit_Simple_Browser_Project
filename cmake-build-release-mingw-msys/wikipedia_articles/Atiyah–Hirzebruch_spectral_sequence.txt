In mathematics, the Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence is a spectral sequence for calculating generalized cohomology, introduced by Michael Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch (1961) in the special case of topological K-theory. For a CW complex 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 and a generalized cohomology theory
