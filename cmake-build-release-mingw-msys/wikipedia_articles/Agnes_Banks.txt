== History ==
This area was settled as early as 1803 by Charles Palmer. He was the first man to receive the free land grants in 1803; he and his wife Mary Anne built the first Farm Slab House the same year. The 3 chimneys still stand near the corner of Castlereagh Rd and Springwood Rd. The town here was once known as 'Little Richmond'. In 1804 Andrew Thompson was given a grant which he named Agnes Bank after his mother.
