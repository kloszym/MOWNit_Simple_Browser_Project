Friedrich Ritter von Röth (1894–1918) was a German First World War fighter ace credited with 28 confirmed aerial victories, 20 of which were observation balloons. The observation balloons were extremely hazardous to attack; they were fleeting targets hooked to motors to draw them rapidly earthward to safety when threatened. They were also ringed with pre-sighted antiaircraft guns, and their vicinity was patrolled by fighter units. Röth was notable as the premier balloon buster of the Imperial German Air Service. Notably, he eschewed single victories over the gasbags, once downing a pair, three times destroying a trio, once a quartet—and on 29 May 1918, he torched five observation balloons within 15 minutes. Overall, Röth made his first ten victories with Jagdstaffel 23 before transferring to Jagdstaffel 16 for his remaining 18 victories.
