Nadir crater is a buried impact crater on the Guinea Plateau in the Atlantic Ocean, 400 kilometres (248 miles) off the coast of Guinea. The feature is named after the Nadir Seamount, located 100 km to the south. The paper announcing the discovery of the feature was published in Science Advances in 2022, with an impact origin being confirmed in 2024. The crater is around 9.2 km (5.7 mi) in diameter, and formed around 66 million years ago, close to the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary when a small asteroid struck the ocean floor.

The crater features all characteristics of an impact crater: appropriate ratio of width to depth, the height of the rims, and the height of the central uplift. It was formed at or near the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary about 66 mya around the same time as the Chicxulub crater. Numerical simulations of crater formation suggested a sea impact at the depth of around 800 m (1⁄2 mi) of a ≥400-m asteroid. It would have produced a fireball with a radius of >5 km (3 mi), instant vaporization of water and sediment near the seabed, tsunami waves up to 1 km high around the crater and substantial amounts of greenhouse gases released from shallow buried black...
