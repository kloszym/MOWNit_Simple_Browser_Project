The Scorpion with Two Tails (Italian: Assassinio al cimitero etrusco, lit. 'Murder in the Etruscan Cemetery') is a 1982 film directed by Sergio Martino.


== Plot ==
Joan has nightmares of Etruscan sacrifices. She knows very well the Etruscan language and her husband Arthur is an archeologist studying Etruscan tombs. In her nightmare, she foresees her husband's death. And Arthur is then killed in the same way the Etruscans killed their sacrifice victims, convincing her that someone (or something) may be after her as well.

== Production ==
The Scorpion with Two Tails originally started life as an 8-part television series to be titled Il mistero degli Etruschi or Lo scorpione a due code. Two original scripts are located in the SIAE archives, one signed by Ernesto Gastaldi and one by Dardano Sacchetti in 1982. The French film producer Jacques Leitienne is also listed in the credits as a co-writer, but this was purely for bureaucratic reasons.
Shooting lasted for four months in Volterra, Cerveteri, Formello, New York City and at R.P.A. Elios Studios in Rome. Although originally made for television, the film was shot on 16mm and blown up to 35mm for its theatrical release.
