== Route ==
The trail runs clockwise from the foot of 9th Street at Wenatchee Riverfront Park and follows the west bank of the Columbia River along Worthen Street. It crosses the river on the historic Columbia River Bridge into East Wenatchee and joins a 2.2-mile (3.5 km) branch that travels southeast towards Rock Island Hydro Park. The trail continues north on the river's east bank, passing through the Porter's Pond Natural Area and intersecting two trailheads located a few blocks west of State Route 28 before reaching a junction with the Rocky Reach Trail. It then crosses the Columbia River on the south side of the Richard Odabashian Bridge, which also carries U.S. Route 2 and U.S. Route 97, and turns south to enter Wenatchee Confluence State Park. The trail crosses the Wenatchee River and re-enters Wenatchee, passing through Walla Walla Point Park and terminating at Riverfront Park.
The 10 miles (16 km) loop trail was reportedly the longest in Washington state...
