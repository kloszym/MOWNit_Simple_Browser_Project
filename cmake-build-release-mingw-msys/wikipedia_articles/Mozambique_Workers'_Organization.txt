The Mozambique Workers' Organization (Organização dos Trabalhadores de Moçambique) (OTM) is a national trade union center in Mozambique.
The OTM was formed in 1983 as a directly controlled arm of the Frelimo political party. However, in 1990 the OTM declared its independence from the party, although critics maintain that it is still close.
