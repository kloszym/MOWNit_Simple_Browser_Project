== History ==

Killamery was the site of a 7th-century monastery associated with the abbacy of St. Gobban, who died 639 and was buried in the grounds of St. Fintan of Clonenagh's Abbey, County Laois. Killamery High Cross is part of the Ossory group of High crosses. This "west Ossory group" also includes the Celtic crosses at Ahenny, Kilkieran and Tibberaghny. In addition to two bullauns and a holy well, the remains of a motte are also located nearby.
The Church of Ireland church in Killamery, St. Nicholas's Church, is included on the Record of Protected Structures maintained by Kilkenny County Council. It was built in 1815 and is now in ruin.
Killamery Hill was known in Old Irish as Dromm Derg (modern Irish: Drom Dearg) meaning "red ridge", and is mentioned in a number of Fenian Cycle poems by this name.
