One Horse Gap is a forest preserve managed by the United States Forest Service, located in the Shawnee National Forest outside Herod, Illinois. It contains a short loop trail named "the gap trail," a narrow section in the bluffs that is only wide enough for one horse to pass through at a time. The trail provides access to Big Grand Pierre Creek, One Horse Gap Lake, War Bluff, and the River to River Trail.


== Geology and history ==
During the Carboniferous period (circa 300 million years before the present), local geological conditions laid down a thick bed of gray sandstone in what is now called Southern Illinois. The eroding sandstone rocks are the remains of mountains that are over 300 million years old. The area is geologically located on the south edge of an east-west trough formed by the northward tilt of the bedrock, and has been greatly affected by earthquakes and uplift. The combined effects of tremors, glacial melt waters, rain, freezing, thawing and wind have naturally sculpted the bluffs into several unusual formations. Unlike much of Illinois, this plateau was never covered by glaciers; the furthest advance of ice sheets during the Illinoisan glaciation stopped just north...
