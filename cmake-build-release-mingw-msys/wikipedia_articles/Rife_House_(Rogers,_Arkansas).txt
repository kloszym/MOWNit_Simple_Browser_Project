The Rife House was a historic house at 1515 South Eighth Street in Rogers, Arkansas.  It was a modest single-story house, built out of concrete blocks cast to resemble rusticated stone.  It had a gable-on-hip roof, with a shed-roof extension to the rear, and a full-width porch across the front.  The porch was supported by four fluted columns fashioned out of concrete blocks.  Built c. 1920, this was a local example of a vernacular house built using a once-popular construction material.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, but has since been destroyed.
