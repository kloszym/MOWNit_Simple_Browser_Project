Typhlodromips swirskii, the Swirski mite (synonymy: Amblyseius swirskii, Amblyseius rykei, Neoseiulus swirskii), is a species of predatory mite in the family Phytoseiidae. It is used in biological pest control of western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) in greenhouse- or indoor-grown crops. It was named for the Israeli entomologist Eliahu Swirski (1921-2002).


== Description ==
The adult T. swirskii has a pear-shaped body and is about 0.5 mm (0.02 in) in length. It has four pairs of legs, the front pair of which points forward, and a small number of paired bristles on the unsegmented body. The colour varies with the diet, being pale yellow or tan when thrips and whitefly are eaten, and reddish on some other diets. It is difficult to distinguish one species of predatory mite from another in the field.


== Distribution and habitat ==
T. swirskii is native to the eastern Mediterranean region where its range includes Italy, Cyprus, Greece, Turkey, Israel and Egypt. It is used as an agent of biological control on crops such as apple, apricot, citrus, cotton and vegetables. It has been introduced to other parts of the world, where the climate is suitable, including much of Europe...
