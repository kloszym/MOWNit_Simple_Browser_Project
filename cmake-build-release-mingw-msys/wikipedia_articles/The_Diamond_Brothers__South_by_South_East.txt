== Synopsis ==
Tim Diamond, the world's most incompetent private detective, lives in a flat above his office in Camden Town with his teenage brother Nick. One day, a mysterious client, by the name of Jake McGuffin, enters their office, and explains that he is an MI6 agent, working with the Dutch secret service to stop a contract-killer called Charon from murdering a Russian diplomat and re-starting The Cold War. He claims that he's being chased by two henchmen and needs to make a call. Since their phone had been cut off, he offers Tim fifty pounds for his overcoat so that he can make it to a telephone box without being seen.
Later on, Nick, the sharper of the two brothers, spots that McGuffin had left his hotel room...
