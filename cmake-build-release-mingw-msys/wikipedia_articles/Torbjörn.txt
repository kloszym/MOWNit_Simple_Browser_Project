Torbjörn, Thorbjörn, Torbjørn, or Thorbjørn (given name) are modern Swedish, Norwegian and Danish forms of the Old Norse and Icelandic name Þorbjörn, meaning thunder (from the name Thor) and bear.
Other variants of the name include the Danish/German form Torben and the predominantly German form Thorben. English variants include Thurburn, Thorburn, Thorbern, Thorebern, Thorber, and Thurber, which are, however, normally used as surnames. Tubby is common in the Norfolk area of England and the early whaling communities of North America.
The Icelandic short form is "Tobbi"; the Swedish is "Tobbe." The supposed site of Þorbjörn's farm in Hrafnkels saga was known as "Tobbahól" by the locals.
