There is a local myth called "The Cockatrice of Church Street". The story goes that the mythical beast resides near the churchyard; those unlucky enough to hear its call are said to never sleep again.

The local church, dedicated to St Cuthbert, is Grade I listed. Most of the building dates from the 14th and 15th centuries, while parts (namely the southern door) can be traced back to the 12th century when England was under Norman rule. According to legends, Cuthbert was buried here.

In 1350 he and his wife Isabel conveyed it to  John de Birthwaite, the Prior of Monk Bretton Priory, to build a chantry  chapel at Woolley   Church, where prayers were to be said for the souls of the royal family as well as Notton's own family...
