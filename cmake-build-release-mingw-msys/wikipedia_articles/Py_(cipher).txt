Py is a stream cipher submitted to eSTREAM by Eli Biham and Jennifer Seberry.  It is one of the fastest eSTREAM candidates at around 2.6 cycles per byte on some platforms.  It has a structure a little like RC4, but adds an array of 260 32-bit words which are indexed using a permutation of bytes, and produces 64 bits in each round.
The authors assert that the name be pronounced "Roo", a reference to the cipher's Australian origin, by reading the letters "Py" as Cyrillic (Ру) rather than Latin characters.  This somewhat perverse pronunciation is understood to be their answer, in jest, to the difficult-to-pronounce name Rijndael for the cipher which was adopted as the Advanced Encryption Standard.

The original April 2005 proposal included the cipher Py, and a simplified version Py6.  The latter reduces the size of some internal tables, providing greatly reduced key scheduling cost, at the expense of a shorter maximum output length.
In June 2006, the authors described Pypy (even more confusingly, half-Cyrillic Pyру and thus pronounced "Pyroo") as an optional stronger variant.  This omits one of the output words from each iteration of Py, and thus operates at slightly over half the speed...
