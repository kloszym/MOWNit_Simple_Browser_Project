1 Chronicles 27 is the twenty-seventh chapter of the Books of Chronicles in the Hebrew Bible or the First Book of Chronicles in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. The book is compiled from older sources by an unknown person or group, designated by modern scholars as "the Chronicler", and had the final shape established in late fifth or fourth century BCE. This chapter comprises five parts: David's military divisions and their commanders  (verses 1–15), the leaders of the tribes  (verses 16–22), a comment on the census (verses 23–24), David's civil officers (verses 25–31), and David's advisers (verses 32–34). The whole chapter belongs to the section focusing on the kingship of David (1 Chronicles 9:35 to 29:30), which from chapter 22 to the end does not have parallel in 2 Samuel.
