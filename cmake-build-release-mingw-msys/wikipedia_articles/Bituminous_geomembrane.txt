Bituminous geomembrane (BGM) is a type of geomembrane consisting of a reinforcing geotextile to provide mechanical strength and elastomeric bitumen (often called asphalt in U.S.) to provide impermeability. Other components such as sand, a glass fleece, and/or a polyester film can be incorporated into the layers of a BGM. Bituminous geomembranes are differentiated from bituminous waterproofing materials used in buildings due in part to their wide roll width, which can exceed 5m, and their substantial thickness of up to 6.0mm.
These properties are designed for environmental protection, civil infrastructure, and mining applications.

The earliest estimated use of bitumen dates back 40,000 years to the Paleolithic age and  the historical use of bitumen as a waterproofing layer is extensive and well documented. 
In 1926, successful experiments were conducted by the South Carolina Highway Department in which cotton fabric was installed on-site in combination with hot bitumen for road surface treatment. Continued experimentation and practical experience led to the development of prefabricated hessian woven fabrics with factory coated bitumen. Known as 'bithess...
