== Political career ==
Following his election as the leader of the Christian Democratic Movement in Slovakia, Figeľ announced his resignation from the Commission on 21 September 2009. He was replaced by Maroš Šefčovič on 1 October 2009.
In 2007, Figeľ received a PhD in the field of social work at St. Elizabeth's School of Medicine and Social Work in Bratislava, a university-level private academic institution. The majority of the thesis was copied from a publication he edited in 2003 with Slovak diplomat Miroslav Adamiš, "Slovakia on the Road to the European Union – Chapters and Contexts", in which they described the country's EU accession process. The rector of St Elizabeth's School, Vladimír Krčméry, said that they took into consideration Figeľ's position and had granted Figeľ a PhD mainly due to the fact that he was at the time serving as a European Commissioner.
