Mordechai Alkahi (Hebrew: מרדכי אלקחי; March 10, 1925 – April 16, 1947) was a member of the Irgun Jewish guerrilla organization in pre-state Mandatory Palestine, and one of 12 Olei Hagardom.


== Early life ==
Alkahi was born in Petah Tikva to an impoverished family. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Turkey. At age 14, he left school and began working to support his family. In his youth, he joined the Maccabi youth movement, a youth movement promoting physical activity and sports, and he became a prominent athlete, particularly in swimming. In 1941, he won first place in a national competition.

After undergoing military training, he joined the Irgun's Combat Corps, or Hayil Kravi (HaK). Even after joining the Irgun, he continued to work in a factory by day, and took part in raids at night. His first Irgun operation was an attack on the Tegart fort in Qalqilya, one of the four Tegart forts attacked that night. The raid failed when the British police saw the attackers approach and poured a withering fire on them, wounding four and forcing them to retreat...
