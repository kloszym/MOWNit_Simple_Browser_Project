Desmos goezeanus is a species of plants in the family Annonaceae found almost entirely within the Wet Tropics bioregion of Queensland, Australia. It is a vine with a stem diameter up to 5 cm (2.0 in). It was originally described as Uvaria goezeana by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1871, and transferred to the genus Desmos by Laurence W. Jessup in 1986.


== Distribution and habitat ==
It grows in well developed rainforest on a variety of soils, at altitudes from sea level up to about 1,000 m (3,300 ft). It is mostly confined to the northeast coast of Queensland from about Cape Tribulation south towards Cardwell, although there are two very disjunct records of collections â€“ one in northern Cape York Peninsula more than 500 km (310 mi) from the nearest collection, and another even further away in the Top End region of the Northern Territory.


== Conservation ==
Desmos goezeanus is listed as least concern under the Queensland Government's Nature Conservation Act. As of 10 January 2025, it has not been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
