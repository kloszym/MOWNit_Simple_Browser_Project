The Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2021 (MFFMA) is a proposed antitrust bill in the United States Congress. The legislation was introduced in the Senate by Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) as S. 228 on February 4, 2021. Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Joe Neguse (D-CO) and Victoria Spartz (R-IN) as H.R. 3843 on June 11, 2021.
The legislation increases filing fees for the largest mergers and acquisitions. In doing so, the legislation intends to increase the amount of available resources for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice's (DOJ) antitrust probes.  The original Senate and House versions of the bill have passed the Senate Judiciary Committee and House Judiciary Committee, respectively.
On September 29, 2022, the House voted to pass a legislative package led by the MFFMA in a 242â€”184 vote. The package also includes the State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act and the Foreign Merger Subsidy Disclosure Act. A version of the legislation was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023.
