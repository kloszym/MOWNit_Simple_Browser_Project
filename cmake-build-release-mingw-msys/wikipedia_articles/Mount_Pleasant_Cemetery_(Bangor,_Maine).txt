Mount Pleasant Cemetery (also known as Mount Pleasant Catholic Cemetery) is a cemetery in Bangor, Maine. Established as Bangor's Roman Catholic burial ground in 1854, it originally included 14 acres. It now includes over 69 acres.
The need for a primarily Roman Catholic burial ground arose from a rapid influx of Irish Catholic immigrants to Bangor in the 1850s and onward. Many Roman Catholic residents from nearby Buck Street Cemetery were re-interred at Mount Pleasant as well.
