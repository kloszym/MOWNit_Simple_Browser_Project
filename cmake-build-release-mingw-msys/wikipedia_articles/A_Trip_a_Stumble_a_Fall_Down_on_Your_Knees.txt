The album was officially announced on February 14, 2024. In a statement regarding the project, Seasick Steve explained "this album was made by mistake, as the title suggests we just tripped and stumbled into it, and it became my favorite album ever and the piece of work I'm most proud of to date. There's not a week goes by that I don't thank my lucky stars for that night on the Hootenanny which has brought us here to this record." To promote the album, Steve did six record store appearances throughout the UK, and performed at Cheltenham Racecourse, Black Deer Festival, Wychwood Festival, and on the Pyramid Stage at the 2024 Glastonbury Festival.
