As shown in the table below, GTK has a range of bindings for various languages that implement some or all of its feature set. GTK 2 is no longer supported, meaning some languages below do not have current GTK support.

GObject (GOB) was initially written as a central component of GTK, but outsourced into GLib.
GObject Introspection is a middleware layer between C libraries (using GObject) and language bindings, e.g. PyGObject uses this, while PyGTK does not.
Official GNOME Bindings follow the GNOME release schedule which guarantees API stability and time-based releases.

Gtk# is a set of .NET Framework bindings for the GTK graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit and assorted GNOME libraries.

Gtk# is an event-driven system like any other modern windowing library where every widget allows associating handler methods, which get called when certain events occur.
Applications built using Gtk# will run on many platforms including Linux, Windows and macOS. The Mono packages for Windows include GTK, Gtk# and a native theme to make applications...
