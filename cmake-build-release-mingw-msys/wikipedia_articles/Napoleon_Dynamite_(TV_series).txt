It earned polarizing reviews, with criticism aimed at the slow pacing and humor, while its' faithfulness to the source material, voice acting, and animation earned the most praise. The series' premiere was seen by over 9.5 million viewers, but the ratings later dropped as the show progressed, with the last four episodes averaging 4 million viewers; it ranked sixth in viewership among teenagers according to the Nielsen Media Research.
On May 15, 2012, the series was cancelled after one season.
