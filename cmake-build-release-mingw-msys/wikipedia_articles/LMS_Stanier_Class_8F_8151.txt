LMS Stanier Class 8F 8151 (British Railways No. 48151) is a preserved British steam locomotive.

The engine originally was allocated to Grangemouth TMD and spent over thirteen years at Grangemouth before being transferred to Canklow in July 1955. Other sheds the engine was allocated to included Staveley in January 1963, Edge Hill (8A) in April 1964, and finally Northwich in March 1966.
