The Master of the Karlsruhe Passion is the notname of a German painter of the late Gothic period active in the Upper Rhine. Very influential on other painters in the region, he may be identified with the Strasbourg painter Hans Hirtz. He is named after his main work, the Karlsruhe Passion, though he may also have been the artist behind the murals in the former Dominican church in Strasbourg, only known through two 17th century copies (a coloured drawing and an etching).


== The Karlsruhe Passion ==
 
The Karlsruhe Passion is an altarpiece on panel showing the Passion of Christ painted for the Saint Thomas Church in Strasbourg around 1450 and split up during the Reformation. From 1858 most of the panels were gathered back together in Strasbourg, meaning that six panels are now in the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe. However, one of the Arrest of Jesus remains in the Wallrafâ€“Richartz Museum in Cologne. Each panel is 46 cm wide and 67 cm high but their original layout is now unknown.
