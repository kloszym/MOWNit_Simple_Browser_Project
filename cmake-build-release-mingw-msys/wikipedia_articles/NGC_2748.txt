NGC 2748 is a spiral galaxy in the northern circumpolar constellation of Camelopardalis, located at a distance of 61.3 megalight-years from the Milky Way. It was discovered September 2, 1828 by John Herschel. The morphological classification of SAbc indicates this is an unbarred spiral with moderate to loosely-wound spiral arms. It is a disk-like peculiar galaxy with a stellar shell that is rotating about the main galactic axis. This shell was most likely formed through the capture and disruption of a dwarf companion. The galactic nucleus likely contains a supermassive black hole with a mass of 4.4+3.5−3.6×107 M☉, or 44 million times the mass of the Sun.


== Supernovae and Luminous Red Nova ==
Three supernovae and one luminous red nova have been observed in NGC 2748.

A magnitude 14.5 supernova, designated SN 1985A, was discovered in this galaxy by Paul Wild on January 25, 1985. It was located 3″ west and 10″ south of the galaxy's nucleus, and was later classified as a type Ia supernova.
On August 31, 2013, a supernova was discovered by Raffaele Belligoli and Flavio Castellani at a position 19″ west and 21″ north of the core of NGC 2748. It was designated SN 2013ff and reached magnitude...
