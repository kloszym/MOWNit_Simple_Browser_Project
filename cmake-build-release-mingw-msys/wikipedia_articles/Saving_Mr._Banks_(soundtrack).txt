Saving Mr. Banks: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack album of the 2013 drama film Saving Mr. Banks, written and conducted by American film composer Thomas Newman.
The album features twenty-five tracks of Newman's score, as well as four re-recordings of songs written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman as performed by the film's cast, and two standalone songs ("One Mint Julep" and "Heigh-Ho"). Walt Disney Records released two editions of the soundtrack on December 10, 2013: a single-disc and a two-disc digipak deluxe edition, with the latter containing original demo recordings by the Sherman Brothers and selected songs from Mary Poppins.
Newman's score was critically lauded and received several accolade recognitions for Best Musical Score, including Academy Award, BAFTA, Grammy Award, and Critics' Choice Award nominations.
