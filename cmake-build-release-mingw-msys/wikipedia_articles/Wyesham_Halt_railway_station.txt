Wyesham Halt was a request stop on the former Wye Valley Railway serving Wyesham, just across the river from the town of Monmouth. It was opened on 12 January 1931 and closed in January 1959 when the line closed to passengers. Some freight traffic on the line continued until 1964, although that did not involve this station.
The halt was located immediately to the East of the Monmouth Viaduct, on an embankment between the River Wye and the Wye valley road, the 1829 Monmouth to Chepstow toll road. The need for a station here was unclear as Monmouth already had two stations and May Hill was also on this side of the river. Although Wyesham is now a residential suburb of Monmouth, at the time it was just a handful of houses; its development did not begin until the time of the line's closure and the edge of the housing now follows the old route of the railway.
Construction was extremely simple, with just a wooden platform and two corrugated iron huts. The starter signal for trains heading southwards was at the end of the platform, controlled from Monmouth Troy. The junction for the Coleford Branch, and its passing loop, was just to the East of modern Wyesham, but had no public access.
