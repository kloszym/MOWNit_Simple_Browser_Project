Lendal  is a street in the city centre of York, in England.


== History ==
The street was first mentioned in the 1380s, when it was known as Aldeconyngstrete (Old Coney Street).  However, by 1641, it had become known as "Lendal", a contraction of "St Leonard's Hill".  This "hill" was the quay on the River Ouse belonging to St Leonard's Hospital, which lay at the north-western end of the street.
Most of the south-western side of the street was occupied by the Augustinian Friary, which was dissolved in 1538.  St Wilfrid's Church lay on the north-east side until it was demolished later in the 16th century.  In about 1710, the city's main post office was built on the south-west side, while the large Judges' Lodgings house was built on the north-east side by Clifton Wintringham about 1720.
For 24 years, a statue of Napoleon outside a tobacconist's shop on Lendal was a local landmark.
York Post Office remained on the street until 2019, when it moved to Coney Street.  Banks, located on Lendal, is the oldest music shop in Britain, having been founded in 1756.
