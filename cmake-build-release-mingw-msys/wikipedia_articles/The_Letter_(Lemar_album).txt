== Critical reception ==

Michael Cragg from The Observer called the album "a classy, patchy soul makeover" and rated the album three stars out of five. L. Michael Gipson from SoulTracks felt that album "sees a return to the covers that made him an instant hit with fans [...] As for whether or not The Letter represents a creative peak or valley, let’s just say it represents more of the same safe choices we’ve seen from Lemar over the last nine or so years, one of more promise than fulfillment."
