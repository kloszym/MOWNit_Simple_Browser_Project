Tremella fibulifera is a species of fungus in the family Tremellaceae. It produces soft, whitish, lobed to frondose, gelatinous basidiocarps (fruit bodies) and is parasitic on other fungi on dead branches of broad-leaved trees. It was originally described from Brazil.


== Taxonomy ==
Tremella fibulifera was first published in 1895 by German mycologist Alfred Möller based on a collection made in Brazil. 


== Description ==
Fruit bodies are soft, gelatinous, whitish, up to 2.5 cm (1 in) across, and lobed. Microscopically, the basidia are tremelloid (subglobose, with oblique to vertical septa), 4-celled, 13 to 18 by 9 to 16 μm. The basidiospores are ellipsoid, smooth, 7 to 10 by 6 to 7 μm.


== Similar species ==
Tremella subfibulifera, also described from Brazil, appears macroscopically identical but differs microscopically in having slightly smaller basidiospores (5.5 to 10 by 4 to 6 μm). DNA sequencing has shown that it is a distinct species. Several other species, including Tremella olens and Tremella neofibulifera, are macroscopically similar and belong within the T. fibulifera complex, but occur in Asia or Australia.  


== Habitat and distribution ==
Tremella fibulifera is a parasite...
