The Häfeli DH-3 was a 1910 Swiss two-seat reconnaissance aircraft, built by the aircraft department of the Federal Construction Works (Eidgenoessische Konstruktionswerkstaette, (K+W)) at Thun, Switzerland.


== Development and design ==
Following the poor performance of the DH-2, August Häfeli designed an improved version the Häfeli DH-3. It was basically the same airframe as the DH-2, the upper wing had a cutout to give a greater field of fire for the pivoting machine gun. 
It was a two-bay aircraft of wood and fabric construction, powered by a 120 hp (89 kW) Argus As II water-cooled inline engine. Initial problems with the landing gear and the engine cooling system led to modifications. Further developments were the re-engined and improved DH-3a, and the DH-3b used for engine trials. Following successful trials with an installation of the Handley Page slats all surviving DH-3as were modified in 1932.


== Operational history ==
On 8 January 1919 a DH-3 inaugurated the first Swiss air mail service between Zurich and Berne. A DH-3 aircraft failed a structural test in 1923 which caused the DH-3 to be withdrawn from service. The DH-3a, following modification, remained in service until 1939...
