Puma was an Italian automobile company which specialized in kit cars and was active from the 1970s to 1990s. Its headquarters were in Via Tiburtina, Rome.
The company's models ranging from off-road vehicles such as dune buggies to sports cars and limited edition, reworked Volkswagen Beetles, redesigned aesthetically and tuned for performance. The first model was the Gatto Spider Spiaggia, a design which emerged from the company's experience in modifying Deserter Dune Buggies.
Puma was founded by businessman Adriano Gatto. Another key figure in the company was Domenico Lombardi, who was originally a technician; his role at Puma included overseeing the development of all models produced by the company.
