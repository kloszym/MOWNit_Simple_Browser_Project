Dijon mustard (French: Moutarde de Dijon) is a traditional mustard of France. It is named after the city of Dijon in Burgundy, which was the center of mustard making in the late Middle Ages and was granted exclusive rights in France in the 17th century. First used in 1336 for the table of King Philip VI, it assumed its current form in 1856 when Jean Naigeon of Dijon replaced the vinegar usually used in prepared mustard with verjuice, the acidic juice of unripe grapes.
The main ingredients are brown mustard seeds (Brassica juncea) and a mixture of white wine, vinegar, water, and salt designed to imitate the original verjuice. It can be used as an accompaniment to all meats, or mixed with other ingredients to make a sauce.


== Commercial production ==
In 2008, the Anglo-Dutch group Unilever, which had several mustard plants in Europe, closed the Amora manufacturing plant. Since July 15, 2009, Amora's Dijon mustard is no longer manufactured and packaged in the town of Dijon, but in the neighbouring town of Chevigny-Saint-Sauveur. The Grey Poupon mustard brand available in the United States originated in Dijon in 1866.
