Fuscina was an early Christian ascetic women and the sister of Avitus, Bishop of Vienne. 
Fuscina was dedicated to Christianity from birth, known as child oblation, and would follow a life of chastity. She confirmed her vows at the age of ten, as documented in De consolatoria castitatis laude ('Concerning the Consolatory Praise of Chastity') (lines 59–62). He wrote De consolatoria laude castitatis to Fuscina around the end of the fifth or early sixth centuries CE. This is the name Avitus himself gives to the poem in his dedicatory letter to Bishop Apollinaris of Valence, his brother. Avitus wrote De consolatoria to reinforce Fuscina's dedication to the radical religious commitment she had made by presenting her with a model of female, spiritual heroism. Using exemplar from Scripture to prove the capacity for female spiritual strength, Avitus delivered a poem that refused to allow the forbearance of his sister and all Christian women to crumble.
