The Sistema de Seleção Unificada (English: Unified Selection System - SiSU) is a digital platform launched in January 2010 and developed by the Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC). It is used by students who attended the National High School Exam (Portuguese: Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio - ENEM) to apply to higher education institutions that use ENEM scores as a method of admission. From 2024, the system will be limited to one edition per year, which will be held in January.
SiSU operates in stages. During the day, it is open for students to select and change their preferences and closes for a two-hour period in the evening to process the ranking. ENEM is also done by people interested in receiving a full or partial scholarship at a private university through the University for All Program (Programa Universidade para Todos - ProUni). Since 2014, it has also been used to obtain financing through the Higher Education Student Financing Fund (Fundo de Financiamento ao Estudante do Ensino Superior - FIES).
