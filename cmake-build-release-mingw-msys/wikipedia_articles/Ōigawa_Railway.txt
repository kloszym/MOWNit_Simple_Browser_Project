The company operates preserved steam locomotives, and has "sister railway" agreements with the Brienz Rothorn Railway in Switzerland and the Alishan Forest Railway in Taiwan. Because of its historical rolling stock and the picturesque scenery, the Ōigawa Main Line is often used for shooting films or TV programs, especially those set in the pre-war period, and has been used as a setting in anime.
