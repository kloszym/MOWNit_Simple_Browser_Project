== History ==
On July 18, 1948, the station signed on for the first time.  It was the first radio station in Chester County, South Carolina, put on the air by Morgan Jones Craig (1920â€“1964), a Chester native with a degree in engineering.  Through his work as an aide-de-camp to a general in the Pacific theatre in World War II, he had developed an interest in radio.  Morgan Craig designed and built the building where WGCD was housed for many years.
The call sign stands for "Wonderful Guernsey Center of Dixie." Chester was well supplied with this variety of dairy cow and Morgan Craig's father, Alec Bell Craig, had guernseys on the family farm (called "Craigbow") outside of Chester.
WGCD was a family business and included locally generated programming. Shortly after World War II, Morgan's sister, Mary Craig, hosted a cooking/homemaking show called "Miss B".
