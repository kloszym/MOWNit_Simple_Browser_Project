ex:el is the third studio album by 808 State, released on 4 March 1991 by ZTT Records. In contrast to the band's previous work, the album features more catchy melodies and heavier acid techno beats and percussion, "embracing earlier flirtations with hip-hop and industrial music".
The album also features the guest vocals of Bernard Sumner of Joy Division and New Order, who sings on "Spanish Heart". In addition, Björk sings on "Qmart" and "Ooops", and is credited with co-writing both; this album marked the start of a long-running working relationship between Björk and Graham Massey.
It is considered to be the first major release to feature the sample from the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory of the phrase "we are the music makers", which became one of the most common vocal samples in electronic music. It is also the first electronic album to feature guest vocals by important alternative rock artists on selected tracks, which became commonplace too on later pop-oriented electronic albums.
