Turbidite Hill (82°1′S 157°45′E) is a low nunatak that lies four nautical miles (7 km) east of Laird Plateau on the north side of Olson Neve in Antarctica. It was mapped by the Holyoake, Cobham and Queen Elizabeth Ranges party of the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE) (1964–65). It was named after sedimentary features, called turbidites, which were reportedly found in sedimentary rocks of the Beacon Supergroup which forms the summit of this hill.


== Geology ==
The exposed bulk of Turbidite Hill consists of a very thick diabase (dolerite) sill that is part of the Ferrar Dolerite. The summit of Turbidite Hill consists of a relatively thin layer of sedimentary rock of the Buckley Formation (Coal Measures), which is part of the Beacon Supergroup. This layer is either a large block of sedimentary rock enclosed within a diabase sill or a layer of sedimentary rock lying between two sills.
At Turbidite Hill, the Buckley Formation consists of cross-bedded medium- and coarse-grained sandstone, thin silty carbonaceous sandstone, muddy siltstone, and thin coal seams. The sandstone exhibits cross-bedding, convoluted bedding, and cross-laminations. Beds of sandstone with...
