The ballroom was located on Fairfield Avenue near Davidson Street and Courtland Avenue.

The hall set a record attendance of 1,724 people in 1943 for a Stan Kenton show, and again that same year with a similar sized crowd for Duke Ellington; a ticket was priced at $0.88. However, in 1950 a one-night event with big band leader Ralph Flanagan drew 3,054 people at $1.50 a ticket.
