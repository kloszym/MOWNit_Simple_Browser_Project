Princess Louise of Anhalt-Dessau was born in Dessau on 21 August 1709 to Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau and Anna Louise Föhse. Prior to her birth, Louise's parents had been in a morganatic marriage until her mother, who was a commoner, was raised to the rank of imperial princess by Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor in 1701. Since their marriage became dynastic, Louise was born as a princess of Anhalt-Dessau.
