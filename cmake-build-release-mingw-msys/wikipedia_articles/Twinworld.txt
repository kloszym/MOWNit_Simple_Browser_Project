Twinworld (also spelled TwinWorld or Twin World) is a video game, published by Ubi Soft for the Amiga and Atari ST in 1989. Ports for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and Acorn Archimedes were released in 1990.
Twinworld is a platform game with a fantasy setting. Ulopa is a prince and the sole survivor of the Cariken royal family. Ulopa must travel through 23 levels to find the stolen amulet and confront the evil wizard Maldur.


== Gameplay ==

The 23 levels are set in five different "worlds": a normal rural landscape, a forest, a medieval-style fortress, swamps and finally the temple of the evil wizard Maldur. The first four "worlds" have five levels each, and Maldur's temple has three, with the last being a special "boss" level.
