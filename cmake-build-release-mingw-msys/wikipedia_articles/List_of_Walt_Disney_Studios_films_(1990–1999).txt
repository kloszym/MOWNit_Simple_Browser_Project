This is a list of films produced and distributed by the American film studio Walt Disney Studios, one of the Walt Disney Company's divisions and one of the "Big Five" major film studios. The list includes films produced or released by all existing, defunct, and sold labels or subsidiaries of the Walt Disney Studios during the 1990â€“1999 time period, which includes Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Touchstone Pictures and Hollywood Pictures. All of these films were produced or financed by Disney. This list also additionally includes films distributed by Miramax Films and Dimension Films from 1993 since Disney held majority ownership of Miramax from that point onward until the end of the decade. Even if outlets like D23 don't consider these films to be Disney films as they were not produced or financed by Disney. Films from Lucasfilm, Marvel Entertainment, and 20th Century Fox are completely excluded from this list as Disney wouldn't acquire their ownership until years later.
All films listed are theatrical releases by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution unless specified.
