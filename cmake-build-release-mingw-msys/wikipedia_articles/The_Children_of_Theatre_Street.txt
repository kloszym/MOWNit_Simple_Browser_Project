== Reception ==
Time's Richard Schick wrote that The Children of Theatre Street "never quite gets up on point", stating that the story is told in "a straightforward, quite artless manner." The New York Times' Janet Maslin also panned the movie, calling it "earnest, plodding and thoroughly earthbound, a fine illustration of how easy it is to demystify artistry by trying too hard to understand it."
The Children of Theatre Street was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.
