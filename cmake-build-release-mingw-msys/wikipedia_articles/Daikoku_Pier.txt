Daikoku Pier (大黒埠頭, Daikokufutō) is an area of Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture. The pier was built as a freight base, but it also functions as a transportation hub for traffic around the Port of Yokohama. It is an access point for the Shuto Expressway and a docking point for large cruise ships. Since it is a hub for a wide variety of economic activities, huge bridges such as the Daikoku Ohashi Bridge and Yokohama Bay Bridge have been built.
