== Background ==
"25 Years" was inspired by a recurring nightmare that the band's frontman Steven Lindsay had about having murdered someone. He explained to the Daily Record in 1990, "It was inspired by a recurring dream. I used to wake up thinking I'd killed someone. It happened so often, it got me thinking that maybe I had actually murdered somebody, and buried them in a ditch somewhere. I became convinced that I'd done something terrible, so I wrote a song about it in which I was put away in prison for 25 years for murder."
