Duddon and Burton is a civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England.  The parish is formed of the villages of Duddon and Burton.


== Location ==
The parish is about 2 miles (3.2 km) south east of Tarvin and 3 miles (4.8 km) west of Tarporley.


== Governance ==
The parish currently falls within the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester and within the Westminster constituency of Eddisbury.
Until 1 April 2015, Duddon and Burton were separate civil parishes. However Burton had neither a parish council nor a parish meeting, and, consequently, the duties that would normally be performed by these bodies were the responsibility of Cheshire West and Chester Council.
From 1 April 2015, Burton parish was merged with Duddon parish to create a new, larger parish. On 1 July 2017 the new parish was renamed to Duddon and Burton.
