== Description ==
Guibourtia tessmannii is a fairly large tree with a dense, rounded crown, growing to a height of about 40 m (130 ft). The trunk is straight and cylindrical, often with tall slender buttresses. It can be up to 2 m (6.6 ft) in diameter and is usually devoid of branches for about half of the tree's height. The greyish or brownish bark has circular scaly patches which become detached, leaving orange depressions. The leaves are arranged spirally and are pinnate, with one pair of ovate or elliptical leaflets, each up to 15 cm (6 in) in length. The inflorescence is a terminal or axillary panicle with thick stems clad in red hairs. The flowers are small, whitish and fragrant, with four sepals, no petals, ten stamens and a superior ovary. They are followed by slightly flattened, leathery pods up to 4 cm (2 in) long containing one or two large, kidney-shaped seeds with orange-red arils.
