The Women's individual compound open was one of the events held in archery at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing.
The competition began with a ranking round, to determine the pairings in the next stage. Britain's Danielle Brown ranked first, setting a world record with 676 points, and was consequently paired against China's Wang Li, who ranked lowest with 551 points. Sweden's Zandra Reppe, second with 658 points was paired against Japan's Chieko Kamiya, seventh with 627 points. Turkey's GÃ¼lbin Su (650) was paired against Sweden's Ann-Christin Nilsson (641), while Britain's Melanie Clarke (647) and Pippa Britton (643) were paired against each other.
In the quarter-finals, the highest ranked archer defeated her opponent in three of the pairs. Brown defeated Wang 107:81; Clarke beat  Britton 110:106; and Su beat Nilsson 112:102. But Kamiya narrowly defeated Reppe 107:106 to advance to the semi-finals.
In the semis, Clarke again found herself against a fellow Briton, Brown, who set a Paralympic record by defeating her 113:107. In the other semi-final, Kamiya again advanced by a very narrow margin, beating Su 106:104. Clarke then won the bronze medal match by beating Su 113:109.
