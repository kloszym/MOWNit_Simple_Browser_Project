On November 9, 2012, the CRTC approved an application by 7954689 Canada Inc. to operate an English language commercial AM radio station in Montr√©al at 600 kHz (class B) with a transmitter power of 10,000 watts daytime and 5,000 watts nighttime.  
On June 28, 2017, a test broadcast began on AM 600 by TTP Media, the same owners as CFNV. The call sign was announced as CFQR (no relation to the former CFQR-FM, now CKBE-FM).
On June 13, 2022, CFQR launched its morning drive program, Mornings Matter. The program was hosted by Jim Connell, a former host at CINW and CKMI-DT. In connection with the launch, CFQR stated that its programming would feature news, information, and talk, along with music from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.
As of 2023, the station is 100% automated with no live programming.
