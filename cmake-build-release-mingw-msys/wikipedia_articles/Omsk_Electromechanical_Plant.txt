Omsk Electromechanical Plant (Russian: Омский электромеханический завод) is a company based in Omsk, Russia.
Founded in 1958, the Omsk Electromechanical Plant was originally an anchor company of the Ministry of Power Engineering and Electrification of Russia. The plant has specialized in electronic equipment for space and missile systems. In the early 1990s the plant has converted from military to civil production, with the result that its space- and defense-related business had reportedly declined to around 15 percent by early 1992.
As of September 1993, the plant was a state-owned enterprise; however, since 1993, it has been a joint-stock company.
