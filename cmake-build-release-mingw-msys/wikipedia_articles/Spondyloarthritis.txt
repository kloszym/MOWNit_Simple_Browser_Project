Spondyloarthritis (SpA), also known as spondyloarthropathy, is a collection of syndromes connected by genetic predisposition and clinical symptoms. The best-known subtypes are enteropathic arthritis (EA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and reactive arthritis (ReA). Symptoms of spondyloarthritis include back pain, arthritis, and enthesitis, inflammation at bone-adhering ligaments, tendons, or joint capsules.
Spondyloarthritis is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is associated with intestinal inflammation, with a connection between Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis. Reactive arthritis is primarily caused by gastrointestinal, genitourinary, respiratory infections, and genetic factors.
Spondyloarthritis is diagnosed based on symptoms and imaging. Early diagnosis criteria use genetic testing and more advanced forms of medical imaging. Spondyloarthritis is categorized into two groups based on the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria: primarily axial involvement and predominantly peripheral manifestations.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are administered first for active axial signs...
