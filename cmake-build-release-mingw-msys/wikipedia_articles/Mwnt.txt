Mwnt (Welsh: [ˈmʊnt]) is an ancient parish in Ceredigion, Wales, 4.5 miles (7.2 km) north of Cardigan. The Wales Coast Path passes through this very small settlement.
It gets its name from the prominent steep conical hill (Foel y Mwnt), a landmark from much of Cardigan Bay, that rises above the beach to a height of 76 m (249 ft), and was formerly anglicised as Mount.


== The beach ==
Mwnt is known for its popular beach, Traeth-y-Mwnt, which has been awarded a Green Coast Award (an award similar to a Blue Flag beach Award but for rural beaches). Swimming conditions are considered safe at Mwnt but there is no lifeguard service.
The Irish Sea off Mwnt is rich in wildlife, being a regular summer home to dolphins, seals and porpoises.


== Flemish invasion ==
Mwnt was the site of an unsuccessful invasion by Flemings in 1155. Its defeat was celebrated, at least in the eighteenth century,  by a games meeting on the first Sunday in January known as Sul Coch y Mwnt (Red Sunday of Mwnt), commemorating the blood shed on that day. Within living memory human bones and skeletons have been exposed in the area. A nearby brook is called Nant y Fflymon (Flemings' Brook).
