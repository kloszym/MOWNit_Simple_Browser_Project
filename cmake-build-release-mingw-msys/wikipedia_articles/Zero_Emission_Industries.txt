Zero Emission Industries, Inc. (ZEI) is an American hydrogen technology company founded in 2018 and headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area. Previously known as Golden Gate Zero Emission Marine, ZEI designs and manufactures hydrogen fuel cell power systems and hydrogen refueling solutions with a focus on maritime applications.
ZEI is best known for designing the hydrogen system onboard the Sea Change (previously known as the Water-Go-Round), the first commercial hydrogen fuel cell ferry in the United States.


== History ==
In 2016, Joe Pratt, a mechanical engineer at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, CA, helped lead a feasibility study to see if a zero-emission hydrogen charter ferry could be built. After working with  two dozen regulatory agencies and a dozen private companies for two years, Pratt and his colleagues at Sandia concluded that it was possible.
In 2017, Pratt co-authored a study examining if hydrogen fuel cell technology could be used in a wide range of maritime vessels, including giant container ships, fishing trawlers, and passenger boats. The study titled “Practical Application Limits of Fuel Cells and Batteries for Zero Emission Vessels” identified hydrogen...
