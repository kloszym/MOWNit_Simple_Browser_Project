The history of the city began in 1836, when John Amie Merle and Mathais Comstock purchased 160 acres (65 ha) of land from the American Government in Grant County. The first structure in the community was erected in 1846 by Jack Deboard. Deboard is considered the first settler in Cuba City.
The name "Yuba City" was finally picked after a dispute about the name of the new village, but after discovering another location had already been given that name, a new name, "Cuba City," was selected.
The community incorporated as a village in Grant County only in 1894. The village incorporated as a city in 1925 and annexed into Lafayette County between 1960 and 1970.
