Louis Poirson, nicknamed "Rambo" (born September 1962 in Madagascar), is a French rapist and serial killer.


== Biography ==
Born into a family of four children of which he is the eldest and the only boy, Poirson was the son of a French father and a Malagasy mother. He claims to have become the scapegoat of his alcoholic father who beat him regularly, often for no reason, under the watchful eye of a passive mother. He then experienced a ferocious hatred towards them.
He was described by the witnesses who succeeded his lawsuits in laudatory terms: "very motivated and pleasant to attend" pupil, an "exemplary" employee and a "considerate" companion.
In 1980, he obtained a sailing CAP and became a boatman on a pusher of the Rhine. His employer lauded his "effective and serious" work and "exemplary" behaviour.
He was endowed with a Herculean strength, and he dreamt of becoming a para-commando. "I love the army and I wanted to become para-commando, for travel, sport and combat", but because of a fibula fracture, he could not become a paratrooper and he was highly disappointed. In 1982, he became a conscript.
