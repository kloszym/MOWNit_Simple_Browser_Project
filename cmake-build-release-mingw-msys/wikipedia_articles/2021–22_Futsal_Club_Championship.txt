The 2021–22 Futsal Club Championship was the inaugural edition of the Futsal Club Championship, an annual futsal club tournament in India organised by the All India Football Federation (AIFF), being held in New Delhi. It was initially planned to be organised in July–August 2020. However, due to COVID-19 pandemic, the championship was held from 5–13 November in K. D. Jadhav Indoor Hall of Indira Gandhi Arena.

The Futsal Club Championship 2021 featured a total of 16 teams, who were divided into four groups, and played in a round-robin format. The highest-placed team from each group made it to the semi-final stage, which was played in a knockout format amongst the four teams. The winners of the tournament, Delhi FC, became the first-ever futsal champions of India, and thus India's first ever AFC Futsal Club Championship representative.
