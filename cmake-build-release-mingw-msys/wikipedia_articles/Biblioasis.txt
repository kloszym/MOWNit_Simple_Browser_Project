Biblioasis is a Canadian independent bookstore and publishing company, based in Windsor, Ontario.
Founded by Dan Wells as a bookstore in 1998, the company began publishing books in 2004 with its first titles being poetry collections by Salvatore Ala and Goran SimiÄ‡. The company has gone on to become one of Canada's most prestigious small press publishing houses; in 2015 alone, the company's titles included Anakana Schofield's Martin John and Samuel Archibald's Arvida, both of which were shortlisted Giller Prize finalists; Russell Smith's Confidence, which was a longlisted Giller Prize nominee and a shortlisted Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize finalist; and Robyn Sarah's My Shoes Are Killing Me, which won the Governor General's Award for English-language poetry.
In 2019, it acquired the North American publishing rights to Lucy Ellmann's Ducks, Newburyport. After it was shortlisted for the United Kingdom's Booker Prize, the book saw heavy demand. Wells stated that Ducks was Biblioasis's fastest-selling title to-date. That same year, Biblioasis published Mark Bourrie's best-seller Bush Runner, which won the $30,000 RBC Taylor Prize for literary non-fiction.
