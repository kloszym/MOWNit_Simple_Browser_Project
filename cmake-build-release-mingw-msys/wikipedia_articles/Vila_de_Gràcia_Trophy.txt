The Vila de Gràcia Trophy (Catalan: Trofeu Vila de Gràcia), officially the Trofeu Vila de Gràcia Memorial Carles Capella, is an annual summer friendly football tournament in the Vila de Gràcia, Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). 


== History ==
In 1995, the tournament was first organised to celebrate the reopening of the Nou Sardenya after three years of remodeling. 
Since that year, the tournament has been disputed every year, except for the editions in 2014 and 2022 (due to constructions in the stadium) and 2020 (due to the COVID-19 pandemic). 
In 2023, it was announced that the tournament was renamed Trofeu Vila de Gràcia Memorial Carles Capella, paying tribute to Carles Capella Amills, a former player of CE Europa.


== Tradition ==
The tournament is usually held on 15 August, coinciding with the Festa Major de Gràcia, and in the Nou Sardenya, the home stadium of the organising Catalan football club CE Europa.
The tournament serves as the official presentation of the first men's team of CE Europa and consists of a single match against an invited team.
In some editions, the tournament consisted of three matches, before adopting a single-match format.
