Ruston is a small village in the county of North Yorkshire, England, forming part of the civil parish of Wykeham. The village is situated just off the A170 road, and approximately 7 miles (11 km) south-west from Scarborough. Ruston is mentioned in the Domesday Book as having ploughlands and woodlands, though the derivation of the name is unknown; it could possibly stem from Hr≈çst, which is Old English for roof-beam.
From 1974 to 2023 it was part of the Borough of Scarborough, it is now administered by the unitary North Yorkshire Council.
