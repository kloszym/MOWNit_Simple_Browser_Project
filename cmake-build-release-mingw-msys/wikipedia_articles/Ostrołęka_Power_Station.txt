The Ostrołęka Power Station (Polish: Elektrownia Ostrołęka) is a coal-fired thermal power station in Ostrołęka, Poland.  It is owned by Energa SA.
The power station consists of two parts. The  Ostrołęka A combined heat and power plant with installed capacity of 93 MW electricity and 456 MW heat was built in 1956.  The Ostrołęka B power station was built in 1972. It consists of three units with combined installed capacity of 647 MW.
There were plans to build an additional unit of 1,000 MW capacity called Ostrołęka C by 2015, with coal supplied by the Bogdanka Coal Mine. The project struggled with financing and delays, and low electricity and natural gas prices made it seem ever more uneconomical. Early 2020, the special purpose vehicle created for the project, Elektrownia Ostrołęka, announced a 90-days hiatus on the building activity to research the possibility to switch the fuel source to natural gas. In May 2020 the indefinite suspension of the partly constructed project was announced, with participating partners writing down PLN1 billion (around $250 million) of investments on the now stranded asset.
