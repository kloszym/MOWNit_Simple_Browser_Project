The 2022 PDC Asian Championship was a tournament organized by the Professional Darts Corporation for Asian players. The tournament featured 48 players from all around Asia, with the four semi-finalists earning a place in the 2023 PDC World Darts Championship and the winner also earning a place in the 2022 Grand Slam of Darts.
Christian Perez won the tournament, defeating Paolo Nebrida 7–5 in the final. Perez, Nebrida, plus semi-finalists Lourence Ilagan and Toru Suzuki all qualified for the World Championship as a result of this tournament, with Perez also qualifying for the Grand Slam, becoming only the second Asian player after Mikuru Suzuki to do so.
This was the first edition of the tournament, which was created following the inability to revive the successful PDC Asian Tour, which had not been able to be run since 2019, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.
