Sawmill Geyser, named for the whirring sound it makes during its eruption, is a geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States.  The geyser was named by Antoine Schoenborn of the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871.
Sawmill is the largest geyser in the Sawmill Complex, a region of geothermal features located in Upper Geyser Basin approximately 10 feet off the path. The geyser has an irregular pattern of eruption due to the underground structural interconnectivity which is characteristic of geyser complexes. Despite this, it tends to have a delay around 1 to 3 hours between eruptions. Often, Sawmill will erupt after the nearby Spasmodic Geyser, but only if Penta Geyser, another significant geyser in the complex, does not erupt first. If Penta erupts before Sawmill, Sawmill is cut off from water, and cannot erupt until the basin is reloaded, indicated by an eruption by Spasmodic. Another eruption indicator is when Sawmill fills with the rest of the geyser's water in the Sawmill Complex or starts to overflow, bubbles tend to rise to the surface. This indicates that an eruption is near. Sawmill drains after its eruptions, and if it had a large eruption prior, unusual behavior...
