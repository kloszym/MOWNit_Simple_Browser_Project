A transforming robot is a robot that can change to take on the appearance or form of another object. This type of robot was a very popular toy concept in the 1980s; such toy robots could typically morph from a humanoid form to that of a vehicle, animal, or commonplace object. The transformation generally was by physically folding/bending/twisting and locking the robot's parts into the new shape, and it very rarely involved disassembling (physically separating) the parts and re-assembling them.
Toylines that used this concept include:

Brave Reideen (Bandai and Popy)
Transformers (Hasbro and Takara Tomy), a very popular franchise with two robot factions that fought against each other. The robots could transform into a wide range of things, like cars, trucks, planes, trains, motorcycles and robot animals.
Gobots and Machine Robo (Tonka, Bandai), mostly die-cast toy robots that could transform into machines like cars, trucks, trains, boats and airplanes
Rock Lords (Tonka, Bandai), robots that could transform into rocks
NEO Shifters (Mattel, Mega Brands), robots that could transform into flying spheres
Changeables (McDonald's), could transform into food products such as french fries or...
