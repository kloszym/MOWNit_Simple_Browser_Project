The Joseph Starr Dunham House is a historic house at 418 Broadway in Van Buren, Arkansas.  Built c. 1870, this 1+1‚ÅÑ2-story wood-frame house is a fine local example of Gothic Revival architecture, with a steeply-pitched side-gable roof that has front-facing gable dormers decorated with sawn woodwork, and a full-width front porch with spiral posts and delicate brackets.  Joseph Starr Dunham, the owner, was a Connecticut native who settled in Van Buren in 1859 and began publishing the Van Buren Press; the house was still in family hands when it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.
