The 2023 Henry Ford Health 200 was the 11th stock car race of the 2023 ARCA Menards Series season and the 35th iteration of the event. The race was held on Friday, August 4, 2023, in Brooklyn, Michigan at Michigan International Speedway, a 2.0 mile (3.2 km) permanent quad-oval-shaped racetrack. The race was initially scheduled to be contested over 100 laps but was extended to 105 laps due to numerous NASCAR overtime attempts. Jesse Love, driving for Venturini Motorsports, would survive a chaotic one-lap shootout and hold off teammate Gus Dean to earn his eighth career ARCA Menards Series win and his sixth of the season. Andrés Pérez de Lara would dominate the majority of the race, starting from the pole and leading a race-high 43 laps, until his engine expired with under 10 laps to go. To fill out the podium, Dean, driving for Venturini Motorsports, and Connor Mosack, driving for Joe Gibbs Racing, would finish 2nd and 3rd, respectively.
