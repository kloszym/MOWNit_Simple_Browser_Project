Out for Blood is the fourth studio album by Unit:187, released on October 5, 2010 by Vendetta Music.


== Reception ==
Fredrik Croona of Brutal Resonance criticized the vocal performances on Out for Blood as being lackluster and said "what this band lacks are really good synthesizer melodies to support the heavily distorted guitars and the blasting drumbeats." Connexion Bizarre called Out for Blood "a powerful album, brimming with emotional performances" and "a wonderful throwback to the golden age of industrial rock: for someone whose musical upbringing was centred around the likes of Ministry, Stiff Miners, Die Krupps, Klute and so forth, it's nothing short of sublime." Trubie Turner of ReGen awarded the album three out of five stars, saying "despite its impressive production and composition, Out for Blood definitely suffers from a tendency to blend together due to its lack of divergence in tempo and gives an overall feeling of being stuck in one gear the entire time" and its "an impressive, heavy, and gritty coldwave showcase that unfortunately comes across as too restrained."
