Ray Arthur Rohwer (April 5, 1895 – September 1, 1988) was an outfielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates. He spent parts of two seasons with the Pirates, playing in 83 games during the 1921–22 seasons. Rohwer came of an old Solano County family. He played college baseball at the University of California, where he joined Theta Xi, before serving in the Army during World War I.
In 83 games over two major league seasons, Rohwer posted a .284 batting average (48-for-169) with 25 runs, 3 home runs and 28 RBI.
After his playing for the Pirates, Rohwer spent nine seasons in the Pacific Coast League, playing for Seattle, Portland and Sacramento. He compiled a career .299 average and rapped out 1,402 hits, 287 doubles, 61 triples and 196 home runs during his time in the PCL, which ran from 1923 until 1931.
