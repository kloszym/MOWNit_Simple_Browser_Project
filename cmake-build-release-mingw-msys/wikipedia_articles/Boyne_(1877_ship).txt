The derelict Boyne survived, however. A steamer towed her into Falmouth, Cornwall, England, and when she reached Liverpool she underwent a refit. She was re-rigged as a barque with an iron mast. It took a while to find a new master for the ship, but finally Captain N. G. Hatch took command and made his first passage to Calcutta, India, without incident.
