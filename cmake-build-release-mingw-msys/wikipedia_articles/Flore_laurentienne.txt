== History ==

The Flore laurentienne is the fruit of thirty years of study, research, gathering, plant collecting, and classification of thousands of specimens. In 1935, in the midst of an economic crisis, it took the energy, charisma and sense of organization of Marie-Victorin, assisted by his collaborators, to bring the manuscript to the presses of the Brothers of the Christian Schools.
From its launch on April 3, 1935, at the Viger Hotel in Montreal, the Flore laurentienne was acclaimed as the bible of French-Canadian naturalists.
