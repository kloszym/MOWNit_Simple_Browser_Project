Jang specifically worked within the United Front Department Section 5 (Literature), Division 19 (Poetry) of Office 101.  Office 101 created propaganda intended to encourage South Korean sympathy for North Korea.

== Biography ==
Jang claims to have been one of the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's favored propaganda poets.  This favoritism occurred after Jang wrote the epic poem Spring Rests on the Gun Barrel of the Lord as part of recurring competitive poetry writing among different North Korean Government departments.  Kim Jong Il liked the poem so much it was redistributed in North Korea in 1999.   Kim Jong Il's favoritism gained Jang the class status of "The Admitted" for which Jang received extra food rations and political protections.
