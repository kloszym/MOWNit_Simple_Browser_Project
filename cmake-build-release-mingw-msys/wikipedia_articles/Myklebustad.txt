Myklebustad is a village in Rana Municipality in Nordland county, Norway. It is located along Norwegian County Road 17 on the southern bank of the Sjona fjord, just west of the villages of Sjonbotn and Utskarpen. Sjona Church is located in the western part of Myklebustad, serving the western part of Rana Municipality.
The district surrounding the inner part of the Sjona fjord originally belonged to Nesna Municipality. On 1 January 1964, this district (population: 543) was merged with the town of Mo i Rana, Nord-Rana Municipality, and the northern part of SÃ¸r-Rana Municipality to create the new Rana Municipality.
