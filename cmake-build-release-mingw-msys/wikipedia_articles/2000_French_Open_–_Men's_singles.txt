Gustavo Kuerten defeated Magnus Norman in the final, 6–2, 6–3, 2–6, 7–6(8–6) to win the men's singles tennis title at the 2000 French Open. It was his second French Open title and second major title overall. The final was a rematch of the Rome final a month prior, in which Norman had prevailed. The final took a dramatic turn in the fourth set, when on match point down, at 15–40 on his own serve, Norman challenged a call that was ruled out, initially ending the match. The umpire overruled in favor of Norman, extending the match, whence Norman would go on to save another nine match points, until 52 points later, Kuerten finally prevailed on the eleventh match point in the fourth-set tiebreak.
Andre Agassi was the defending champion, but lost in the second round to Karol Kučera.
