Live to Dance is an American television reality television series and dance competition on the CBS network based on the British series Got to Dance. Dancers from all over the country auditioned for Live to Dance in "specially constructed Dance Domes".
Resembling the British dance competition series Got to Dance, the show was first shown on January 4, 2011, and was headlined by the American Idol judge Paula Abdul as lead judge with Andrew Günsberg as host. Judging alongside Abdul were Kimberly Wyatt, the former member of Pussycat Dolls, and Michael Jackson's long-time choreographer Travis Payne. The show was intended to rival So You Think You Can Dance and unlike most other reality shows, allowed dancers of all ages to compete. The series was not renewed for a second season.
An Australian version was filmed in 2011. However, it never aired due to a scheduling conflict by another reality dance competition series Everybody Dance Now in 2012.
