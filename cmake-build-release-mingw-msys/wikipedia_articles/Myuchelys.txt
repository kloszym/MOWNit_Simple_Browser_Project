The Myuchelys is a genus of turtles, the Australian saw-shelled turtles,  in the family Chelidae and subfamily Chelodininae. They inhabit the headwaters and tributaries of rivers within their range and this led to the name Myuchelys, which is formed from the Aboriginal word myuna meaning clear water and the Greek chelys meaning turtle. They have a short neck and the intergular scute completely separates the gular scutes. They have no alveolar ridge separating them from the snapping turtles of the genus Elseya.


== Species ==
The genus currently contains these cryptic small species of freshwater turtles, endemic to eastern and northern Australia:

Myuchelys bellii, Namoi River snapping turtle Gray, 1844
Myuchelys georgesi, Bellinger River snapping turtle Cann, 1997
Myuchelys latisternum, saw-shelled turtle Gray, 1867
Myuchelys purvisi, Manning River snapping turtle 


== Taxonomic history ==
The species Myuchelys latisternum was originally placed in the genus Elseya by Gray in 1867 but Elseya was redefined by George Albert Boulenger in 1889 to include species defined by the presence of an alveolar ridge. Hence, Myuchelys latisternum and Myuchelys novaeguineae were moved to the genus Emydura...
