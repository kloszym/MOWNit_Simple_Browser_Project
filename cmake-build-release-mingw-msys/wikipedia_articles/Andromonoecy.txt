Andromonoecy is a breeding system of plant species in which male and hermaphrodite flowers are on the same plant. It is a monomorphic sexual system comparable with monoecy, gynomonoecy and trimonoecy. Andromonoecy is frequent among genera with zygomorphic flowers, however it is overall rare and occurs in less than 2% of plant species. Nonetheless the breeding system has gained interest among biologists in the study of sex expression.


== Etymology ==
The word andromonoecious is a combination of  andr- (meaning male) and monoecious and was first used in 1877.


== Prevalence ==
Andromonoecy is uncommon and has been estimated to occur in less than 2% of plant species. In angiosperms, it occurs in 1.7% of angiosperms making up around 4000 species in 33 families. It is common in the grass subfamily Panicoideae.
