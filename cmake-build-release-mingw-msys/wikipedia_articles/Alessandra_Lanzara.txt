Alessandra Lanzara is an Italian-American physicist and the distinguished Charles Kittel Professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley since 2002, where she leads an experimental materials physics group. She is the founding director of Center for Sustainable Innovation at UCB and the co-founder of Quantum Advanced Detection (QUAD) LLC.


== Education ==
Lanzara obtained her Laurea in physics (equivalent to an M.S., 1994) and doctorate in Physics and Materials Sciences (1999) from the University of Rome La Sapienza in Italy. Lanzara subsequently held a postdoctoral fellowship appointment at Stanford University until 2002.
In 2002, Lanzara joined UC Berkeley Physics Department as assistant professor and was promoted associated professor with tenure in 2006. She advanced to Full Professor in 2011. She was named 2019-2020 Bakar Fellow for advancing her materials work in quantum computing applications.


== Research ==
Lanzara is best known for her original contribution to the study of quantum materials such as high temperature superconductors, topological phases of matter and two dimensional materials.  Her contributions include the discovery of spin momentum locking and electron...
