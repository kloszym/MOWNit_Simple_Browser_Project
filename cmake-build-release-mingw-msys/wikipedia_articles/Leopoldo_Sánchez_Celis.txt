Leopoldo Sánchez Celis (February 14, 1916 – August 7, 1989) was a Mexican politician who was governor of Sinaloa from 1963 to 1968.
He belonged to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), having been elected as a Senator for that party representing Sinaloa. 
One of his personal bodyguards was the drug trafficker and ex-police officer Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, with whom he maintained an extensive friendship, so much so that Félix Gallardo was the best man at the wedding of one of his sons, Rodolfo Sánchez Duarte, in 1983. 
He was tortured and murdered, allegedly on the orders of Félix Gallardo after some fight between Sánchez Celis and him, or because of the alleged links of the governor with drug trafficking.
