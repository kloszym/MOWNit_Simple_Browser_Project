Miss Nightingale - The Musical is a British cabaret musical, telling the story of a love triangle between singing star Maggie, her composer George, and their producer Frank. Set in a London nightclub during the Second World War, the show contains elements of bawdy comedy alongside the central romantic drama, and explores both the female and homosexual experience against the backdrop of fascism.
Miss Nightingale was conceived and produced by Matthew Bugg, who wrote the libretto and the score. The piece was first presented at The Lowry, Greater Manchester and the King's Head Theatre, London in 2011. The West End premiere took place at the Hippodrome Theatre in 2018.
