The Stinson Voyager was an American light utility monoplane built during the 1940s by the Stinson Aircraft Company.


== Development ==
First developed as the Stinson HW-75 and marketed as the Model 105 in 1939, the design was a high-wing three-seat braced monoplane powered by either a 75-hp (63.4-Kw) Continental A-75 or an 80-hp (67.7-Kw) Continental A-80-6. This was developed into the Model 10, introduced in 1940, powered by a Continental A-80 piston engine. The Model 10 introduced a wider cabin as well as an improved standard for the interior and finish. In 1941 the Model 10 was followed by the Model 10A, powered by a Franklin 4AC-199 engine and the Model 10B with a Lycoming GO-145. The 10A was the last of the series, but the first to be called "Voyager", a name that was retained for the post-war Stinson 108.
Six Model 10s were evaluated by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) as the YO-54. The unsuccessful tests led Stinson to design an all-new aircraft designated Model 76, later known as the L-5 Sentinel.
A number of Model 105s and Model 10As were impressed into USAAF service as the AT-19 (later L-9). However, the AT-19 designation has not been verified.
