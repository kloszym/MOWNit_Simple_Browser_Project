The Griffin Brothers were an American rhythm and blues band from Norfolk, Virginia, sometimes credited on record as the Griffin Brothers Orchestra.  They made successful recordings with singer Margie Day, and had a no.1 hit on the Billboard R&B chart in 1951 with "Weepin' and Cryin'", featuring Tommy Brown.


== Biography ==
The group was formed by brothers Jimmy (born James Rudolph Griffin, Norfolk, Virginia, November 26, 1921–November 14, 2000) and "Buddy" Griffin (born Edward Elijah Griffin, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, October 5, 1919–October 22, 1981).
By 1920, the family lived in Norfolk, Virginia.  Both Jimmy and Buddy studied music at the Juilliard School. Jimmy played trombone, and Buddy played piano.  The band was completed by Wilbur Dyer (alto saxophone), Virgil Wilson (tenor saxophone), Jimmy Reeves (bass), and Emmett "Nab" Shields (drums).  In the late 1940s they played local clubs in Washington, D.C., as well as Virginia and North Carolina, and added a singer, Margie Day.  In early 1950 the band recorded as back-up to Roy Brown on the session for DeLuxe Records that yielded his no.1 R&B hit, "Hard Luck Blues".
