Home Castle was launched in Aberdeen in 1811. From 1813 on she was a whaler in the British northern whale fishery (Greenland and Davis Strait). She was lost in 1829, while whaling in Davis Strait.


== Career ==
Home Castle first appeared in the Register of Shipping (RS) and in Lloyd's Register in 1813.

Home Castle then made 16 annual voyages to the Northern Whale Fishery, being lost on her last. Between 1813 and 1824, she sailed from Bo'ness (Borrowstounness). Then from 1825, to her loss she sailed from Leith. Even when she belonged to Leith, she would go up to Bo'ness to boil her oil there and to overwinter.
The data below came primarily from Coltish:

On her way to Davis Strait in early 1816, Home Castle became leaky and had to put into Burnt Islands, Newfoundland and Labrador to effect repairs.


== Fate ==
Home Castle was wrecked on the coast of the Davis Strait, either while crossing or after having crossed Melville Bay. Ice closed in on her, crushing her on 8 July. She was just behind Eagle, so close that Home Castle's jib boom projected over Eagle's taffrail, but Eagle was unharmed.  
Lady Jane rescued two of Home Castle's crew and took them into Newcastle.
