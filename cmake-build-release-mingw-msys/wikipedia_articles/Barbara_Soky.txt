Barbara Soky (born Bara Sokoroma) is a Nigerian actress and former singer who rose to fame in the TV soap Mirror in the Sun. Following a hiatus after various roles in the 1980s and 1990s, Soky revived her acting career, appearing in Nollywood movies and other soaps.


== Acting ==
Soky's first major acting role was as office receptionist Rosemary Hart in the NTA series Inside Out. Originally an NTA Port Harcourt production, the sitcom gained popularity across Eastern Nigeria following syndication within other NTA stations via exchange. Soky also had a part alongside Adiela Onyedibia in You Can't Take Your Wife to New York, a series about a Nigerian ambassador with an illiterate wife.
After Inside Out ended, Rivers-native Soky moved to Lagos where she starred in Lola Fani-Kayode's serial Mirror in the Sun. Her role as Yinka Fawole, a seductive young woman in love with two polar opposites, shot her to national stardom and led to a commercial for Jik bleach. After Mirror in the Sun, Soky was among the original cast of Ripples as unlucky-in-love city lawyer Daphne Wellington-Cole, from 1988 to 1993. Soky would later reprise her role in the show's 2022 revival Ripples: The New Generation....
