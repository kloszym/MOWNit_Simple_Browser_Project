Jin or Chin (진) is the romanization of a number of Korean surnames, written as 陳, 秦, 眞, or 晉 in hanja.
While some earliest figures of the surname date back to the Korean Kingdom of Baekjae and Silla, other figures include the early Chinese who immigrated to Korea during the era of Goryeo dynasty.       
Similar to the Korean surname Jin, the Chinese surnames Chen and Qin also use the Chinese characters 陳 and 秦.
