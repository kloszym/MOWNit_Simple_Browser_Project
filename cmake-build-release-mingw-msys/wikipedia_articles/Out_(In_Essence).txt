Out (In Essence) is a live album by British electronica group Fluke, first released in August 1991.


== About the album ==
The tracks on this album all came from Fluke's first album, The Techno Rose of Blighty. The album was recorded live at Destination Moon, an acid house party held at the Rolling Stones’ manor house. At this time it was also considered somewhat of a pioneering step for an electronic band to record a live album with band member Jon Fugler commenting, "Nobody believed a dance band could play live. It was a time when you didn’t know if the computer would last the whole show."

"Pan-Am Into Philly"

"Philly" (Techno Rose Remix)
