Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana (Ojibwe language: Esensininiwag) is a federally recognized tribe of Ojibwe, MÃ©tis, and Cree people in Montana. The name of the tribe is often shortened to Little Shell. In 2023, the population of enrolled tribal members is approximately 6,900. The Tribe's headquarters is in Great Falls, in a 35,000-sq. foot office complex.
The Little Shell Tribe is named after its 19th-century leader, Esens, known as "Little Shell." The Tribe was also referred to as the Little Shell Band of "Landless" Chippewa Indians of Montana because it did not have an Indian reservation, resulting from conflicts with federal authorities dating back to the 19th century. Although considered "landless", the tribe gained state recognition from Montana in 2000. On December 20, 2019, the National Defense Authorization Act was signed into law, finally granting the Tribe federal recognition. The Tribe owns over 800 acres of land in and around Great Falls, Montana, and manages the Hell Creek Recreation Area.
