Partial-matching is a technique that can be used with a MITM attack. Partial-matching is where the intermediate values of the MITM attack, 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
  
, computed from the plaintext and ciphertext, are matched on only a few select bits, instead of on the complete state.

A limitation with MITM attacks is the amount of intermediate values that needs to be stored. In order to compare the intermediate values

 and

 can be compared against them. 
If the two subciphers identified by the MITM attack both has a sufficiently large subkey, then an unfeasible amount of intermediate values need to be stored.
While there are techniques such as cycle detection algorithms that allows one to perform a MITM attack without storing either all values of...
