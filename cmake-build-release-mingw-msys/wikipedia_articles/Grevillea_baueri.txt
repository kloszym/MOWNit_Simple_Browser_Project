== Description ==
Grevillea baueri is a low, spreading to erect shrub that typically grows to a height of up to 0.3–1.5 m (1 ft 0 in – 4 ft 11 in). Its leaves are simple, oblong to egg-shaped, 10–30 mm (0.39–1.18 in) long and 3–15 mm (0.12–0.59 in) wide with the edges turned down or rolled under, the lower surface more or less glabrous. The flowers are arranged in groups of eight to eighteen near the ends of branches or in leaf axils on a rachis 2–5 mm (0.079–0.197 in) long, and are red to pink and cream-coloured to yellow near the tip, with a red style. The pistil is usually 16–23 mm (0.63–0.91 in) long, the ovary covered with long hairs. Flowering mainly occurs in winter and spring and the fruit is a hairy follicle 13–14 mm (0.51–0.55 in) long.
