The Ledbury is a restaurant located on Ledbury Road, Notting Hill, London, England. It held two Michelin stars from 2010 until 2021, when it lost them as it shut due to Covid-19 restrictions being impractical for the restaurant, making it ineligible for assessment by Michelin inspectors. It has also been featured in S.Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants. The restaurant reopened in February 2022, after being closed for almost 2 years. It regained both Michelin stars in the 2023 Michelin Guide and was promoted to three Michelin stars in the 2024 Michelin guide.
The chef-patron is Brett Graham, and he has been received favorably by critics. Graham continues to actively run the kitchen alongside head chef Tom Spenceley.

The restaurant opened in 2005. It was the sister restaurant of The Square, a two-Michelin-starred restaurant in Mayfair, London, with the same backers investing in both restaurants. The Square closed permanently in early 2020. The restaurant gained a Michelin star within a year of opening, but sales only increased by 2009. A second Michelin star followed in 2010. Also in 2010, it was awarded the Square Meal BMW Restaurant of the Year Award.
