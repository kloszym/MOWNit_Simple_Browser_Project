Breath Rhyme is an album by American jazz saxophonist Rob Brown recorded in 1989 and released on the Swedish Silkheart label.


== Background ==
After his debut album co-led with pianist Matthew Shipp, Sonic Explorations, which was privately recorded and then sold, this was his first real studio date. It features a trio with bassist William Parker and drummer Denis Charles playing all original Brown compositions. Parker and Charles had worked together a lot before, with Jemeel Moondoc and some other bands. Brown first played with Parker in a trio with drummer Frank Bambara in 1987. He put together the trio with Parker and Charles for a gig at the Knitting Factory the same year.


== Reception ==

In his review for AllMusic, Scott Yanow says about the trio that "is a throwback in ways to the intense projects recorded by the ESP label in the 1960s, but it is also more modern, looking toward Cecil Taylor."
The Penguin Guide to Jazz states "Brown first record looked back to the frantic avant-gardism of the '60s and forward to a new, third way approach which combine that freedom and radicalism of purpose with a more melodic and expressive idiom."
