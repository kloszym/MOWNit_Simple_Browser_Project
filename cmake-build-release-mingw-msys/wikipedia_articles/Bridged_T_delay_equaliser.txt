The bridged-T delay equaliser is an electrical all-pass filter circuit utilising bridged-T topology whose purpose is to insert an (ideally) constant delay at all frequencies in the signal path.  It is a class of image filter.


== Applications ==
The network is used when it is required that two or more signals are matched to each other on some form of timing criterion.  Delay is added to all other signals so that the total delay is matched to the signal which already has the longest delay.  In television broadcasting, for instance, it is desirable that the timing of the television waveform synchronisation pulses from different sources are aligned as they reach studio control rooms or network switching centres.  This ensures that cuts between sources do not result in disruption at the receivers.  Another application occurs when stereophonic sound is connected by landline, for instance from an outside broadcast to the studio centre.  It is important that delay is equalised between the two stereo channels as a difference will destroy the stereo image.  When the landlines are long and the two channels arrive by substantially different routes it can require many filter sections to fully equalise...
