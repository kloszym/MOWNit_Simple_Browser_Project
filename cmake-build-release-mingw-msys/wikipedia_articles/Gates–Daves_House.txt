The Gates–Daves House, also known as The Daves Place, is a historic residence in Mobile, Alabama.  The one-story structure was built in 1841 with a Creole architectural influence, the best remaining example of its type in Mobile.  It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 20, 1974, due to its architectural significance.


== History ==
The Gates–Daves House stands on a portion of a Spanish land grant deeded to Antonio Espejo during Mobile's colonial period.  In 1841 the property was purchased by Hezekiah Gates from Charles Dellinger for $3500, local tradition maintains that the house was constructed that same year.  Gates's widow, Adele then sold the house to Camellia Bull in 1850 and she in turn sold to Thomas K. Daves in 1856.
