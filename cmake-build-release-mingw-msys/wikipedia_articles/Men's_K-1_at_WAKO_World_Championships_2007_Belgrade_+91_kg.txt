The men's super heavyweight (over 91 kg/200.2 lbs) K-1 category at the W.A.K.O. World Championships 2007 in Belgrade was the heaviest of the K-1 tournaments, involving thirteen fighters from two continents (Europe and South America).  Each of the matches was three rounds of two minutes each and were fought under K-1 rules.
Due to the shortage of fighters required for a sixteen-man tournament, three men had byes through to the quarter-finals.  The tournament winner was Belarus's Aliaksei Kudzin who defeated the Russian Dzhamal Kasumov in the final to win gold.  Defeated semi finalists Mirko Vlahovic from Montenegro and Mladen Bozic from Serbia won bronze medals.
